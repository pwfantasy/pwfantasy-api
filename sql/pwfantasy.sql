For the brutally vicious competitor known as Abdullah the Butcher, these words couldn\'t be more appropriate.\nInternationally known as The Madman from the Sudan, the 400-pounder has terrorized opponents, officials and fans in rings across the globe for more than half a century. Whether he was competing in the grandest arenas of Japan or the dingiest high school gymnasiums in the Midwest, The Butcher attacked his opponents with an unmatched ferocity, jabbing at his victims with a rusted dinner fork and lunging at hapless spectators who dared to get too close to the monster.\nIn all this time, Abdullah\'s distinctive look has barely changed — his baggy judo pants hiked high above his bulging belly, his eyes mad and wandering like a schizophrenic, his forehead carved so deeply with scars that he can firmly insert quarters into the wounds like a coin slot.\nThis unique appearance and the promise of bloodshed gave The Butcher the rare ability to “pop a territory.” In the days when sports-entertainment was mostly a regional attraction, a promoter could hire Abdullah to come to town and wreak havoc for a few months. The Madman would march into Texas or Quebec with his fork in hand and slice up a local hero like Terry Funk or Jacques Rougeau Sr. Within weeks, fans would be lined up down the block to witness The Butcher and profits would explode.\nIf the money was right, Abdullah would be there. He battled Andre the Giant in front of 25,000 fans in Puerto Rico and clashed with Hulk Hogan in Japan. His ghastly wars with Bruiser Brody and Carlos Colón defined hardcore action decades before Paul Heyman’s Extreme Championship Wrestling exploded on the scene. The list of The Butcher’s rivals reads like a Hall of Fame itself — The Sheik, Harley Race, Bobo Brazil, Jack Brisco, Stan Hansen, Giant Baba. All these men can attest to the same fact — a champion wasn’t a champion until he came face to face with Abdullah the Butcher.\nA true independent, The Butcher would never stay in one place for too long, preferring to keep on moving to the next city in search of a bigger payday. This elusiveness prevented Abdullah from ever having a big pay-per-view match, but he received some major North American exposure in 1991 with World Championship Wrestling. Introduced by Cactus Jack as a threat to Sting, The Butcher participated in the infamous Chamber of Horrors Match in which he was fried in an electric chair. It wasn’t the greatest showcase of Abdullah’s talents, but it presented him as a monster to a whole new generation of fans.The Butcher has battled every legend in nearly every promotion on the planet — except WWE. Despite his decades in the ring, Abdullah never brawled with Hulk Hogan for the WWE Championship or went the distance with Bret \"Hit Man\" Hart in Madison Square Garden. These are dream matches that will never happen, but these icons were all brought together when The Butcher took his rightful place alongside them in the WWE Hall of Fame.');

In 1993, WWE unleashed that last resort upon the squared circle. Hailing from Three Mile Island — the site of a nuclear meltdown in Pennsylvania during the late 1970s — Adam Bomb caused a mushroom cloud of destruction in his wake. But within two years of debuting, he was gone.Introduced to WWE by preppy loudmouth Johnny Polo, the six-foot-six, 290-pound radioactive bruiser was a sight to behold with his protective goggles, a mane of long dark hair,glowing yellow eyes and a bright red tongue. The toxic monster manhandled the competition with victories over Virgil, Tito Santana and a host of others. His impressive victories even led him to a bout against top hero Bret Hart less than four months after his debut.After coming up short in a rivalry against The Undertaker, Bomb dropped Polo as his manager and joined with Harvey Wippleman. Bomb and the diminutive Wippleman made for quite an odd couple, but it proved rewarding as the atomic powerhouse continued to notch wins over Superstars like Marty Jannetty and The 1-2-3 Kid. Irwin R. Schyster noticed the rookie’s success and recruited Bomb for his 1993 Survivor Series team. Bomb went on an absolute tear in his pay-per-view debut, and lasted the longest among the cadre of villains.At WrestleMania X inside Madison Square Garden, Bomb suffered his most humbling defeat to date, succumbing to the monstrous Earthquake. Wippleman began to voice his frustrations with his client and the rift caused a nuclear meltdown between the duo with the sniveling Wippleman choosing to focus on his other charge, Kwang. Wippleman’s ninja battled it out with Bomb throughout summer 1994, with fans electing to side with Bomb for the first time in his career.A newly energized and heroic Adam Bomb seemed to be more powerful than ever. He held his own against the likes of Yokozuna and The Million Dollar Corporation’s Bam Bam Bigelow and Tatanka. But after a loss to Mabel in less than two minutes on the first In Your House pay-per-view, Bomb’s nuclear reactor slowly fizzled away from WWE in 1995, leaving him to incur his wrath elsewhere.');

This bold New Jersey native first introduced herself to the WWE Universe on the third season of WWE NXT. She finished in third place, but won many WWE fans with her lucha-inspired moveset and indomitable fighting spirit.A year after debuting on SmackDown in May 2011, AJ was pivotal in the 18-second outcome of the World Heavyweight Championship Match at WrestleMania XXVIII with a kiss to her beau, Daniel Bryan. The couple’s subsequent breakup sent AJ into an emotional tailspin, and went on to become romantically entangled with WWE’s top Superstars, including CM Punk, Kane and even John Cena.Following a brief and controversial stint as Raw’s General Manager — a tenure marred by controversy due to her increasingly erratic behavior — AJ found herself in the arms of the brash Dolph Ziggler. Coincidentally enough, it was in the femme fatale’s home state that The Showoff “cashed in” his Money in the Bank contract on Alberto Del Rio to become the World Heavyweight Champion just one night after WrestleMania 29.It wasn’t long before AJ claimed a championship of her own. After winning a No. 1 Contender’s Divas Battle Royal on Raw, AJ defeated former friend Kaitlyn to ensnare the Divas Title, and would go on to hold that prize for a record-shattering 295 days until she was unseated by NXT Women’s Champion Paige the day after WrestleMania 30.

Intimidating foes with the skulls tattooed into the side of his mohawked head, The Gang didn’t need any help, as he could dispatch multiple opponents at once with his bone-crushing 747 Splash.The One Man Gang entered WWE in 1987, making an immediate impact by ending the in-ring career of WWE Hall of Famer “Superstar” Billy Graham. Led by the nefarious Slick, the Chicago native went on a path of destruction, tearing through competition with ease. To satisfy his craving for chaos, The Gang went after WWE officials, racking up fines in tens of thousands of dollars.While Slick was satisfied with his charge’s devastation, “The Doctor of Style” wanted the damage to come with a little flair. That’s why, in September 1988, Slick promised that a transformation would take place. He summoned “Mean” Gene Okerlund to a mysterious alley, where tribal dancers gyrated around a burning garbage can. At the crescendo of Slick’s hype job, the flame burst and The One Man Gang emerged, wearing a bright yellow shirt adorned with African patterns and one of the biggest kufi hats we’ve ever seen.The big man boogied over to his manager and a stunned Okerlund. Slick made it clear that The One Man Gang was no more — he was reborn as Akeem. Dubbed “The African Dream,” the big man embraced his inner soul, matching Slick dance step for dance step down to the ring before squashing his hapless foes.Akeem soon found a partner in corrections officer–turned-Superstar The Big Boss Man. The duo known as The Twin Towers wreaked havoc on WWE throughout 1989. When they weren’t trying to take the World Tag Team Titles from Demolition, Akeem and The Boss Man caused a rift in the friendship of Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage, leading to the ugly breakup of The Mega Powers.As the 1990s rolled in, though, The Twin Towers’ partnership came to an end. After The Big Boss Man refused to be bought by “The Million Dollar Man” Ted DiBiase, the wealthy Superstar paid off “The African Dream” to take out his former friend. When the two behemoths collided at WrestleMania VI, The Boss Man emerged victorious, and Akeem left WWE shortly after.He ditched the funky persona upon his return to WCW, going back to his roots as The One Man Gang.

A tall, attractive stunner with a fast smile and no shortage of attitude, Blayze had clawed her way out of frostbitten armories in the Midwest to become a mainstream celebrity in Japan and the competitor who almost singlehandedly revitalized the Women’s Championship in WWE. And she did it with the same moxie that led her to trash a title on TV.Breaking into sports-entertainment in the mid-80s, Blayze started out in Verne Gagne’s American Wrestling Association with the ring name Madusa Miceli. She may have been inexperienced, but her long legs and revealing outfits introduced a bit of rock star appeal that was uncommon in Minnesota rings at the time.Tangling with future WWE Hall of Famers like Wendi Richter and Sherri Martel, Blayze developed quickly and earned passage to All Japan Women\'s Pro-Wrestling. The greatest showcase for female talent that ever existed, AJW boasted icons like Bull Nakano and Aja Kong, who helped Blayze develop into not only a well-rounded grappler, but a minor celebrity in Japan.Upon returning to the U.S., Blayze entered WCW where she served as a villainous member of Paul Heyman’s Dangerous Alliance and a close ally to “Ravishing” Rick Rude. She broke out as a competitor on American soil in 1993 when she joined WWE as the face of a revamped Women’s Championship. Defeating Heidi Lee Morgan to win the vacant title, Blayze introduced the physical Japanese style to the States through a series of grisly bouts against Nakano and Kong.When interest in the Women’s Championship waned, WWE disbanded the division and released all female competitors including Blayze, who was still the WWE Women\'s Champion. Blayze was immediately hired by WCW where she would finish out her ring career once again as Madusa. Following her controversial dumping of the title, she battled dangerous opponents like Akira Hokuto and Luna Vachon, linked up with “Macho Man” Randy Savage and even defeated Evan Karagias to win the WCW Cruiserweight Title.Blayze was honored for her illustrious career when she was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame on the eve of Wrestlemania 31.Blayze retired from the ring in 2001 after nearly two decades as one of the most revered women in all of wrestling.

Throughout the ’70s and well into the ’80s, the so-called “Eighth Wonder of the World” was the company’s leading attraction, towering over the competition at seven feet, four inches tall and tipping the scales at a gargantuan 500-plus pounds.Raised in a small French farming village, Andre lived a quiet, pastoral life as a child. However, his size was an issue almost from the start. Born with acromegaly, a disorder that causes bones to grow at an accelerated rate, Andre stood 6-foot-3 and weighed 200 pounds by the time he was 12 years old.His size having grown to abnormal proportions, Andre opted to turn his situation into something positive, entering the wrestling world at the relatively young age of 18. In those days, the sport was still a regional attraction, and yet Andre managed to captivate audiences wherever he went and become a fan favorite in every territory.After making an impact in Japan and Canada, the 27-year-old giant was taken under the wing of Vincent McMahon Sr. in 1973. Andre spent the next 20 years with WWE, even going so far as to turn down a contract from the NFL’s Washington Redskins in order to remain with the promotion.In WWE, Andre’s already burgeoning career caught fire. He blazed through WWE on an unprecedented winning streak, remaining undefeated for nearly 15 years. Throughout heated rivalries with such Superstars as \"Big Cat\" Ernie Ladd, Blackjack Mulligan and even Hulk Hogan (whom Andre defeated in an epic clash at Shea Stadium in 1980), no one could overpower the giant.Beyond his undeniable prowess in the ring, Andre also enjoyed massive crossover success, the likes of which would not be seen again until The Rock dominated Hollywood starting in 2002. During the ’70s, he made a number of guest appearances on TV, including “The Tonight Show” and “The Six Million Dollar Man” (where he played, of all things, Bigfoot). But perhaps his most famous role was in 1987 when he played the gentle-hearted giant Fezzik in Rob Reiner’s smash hit comedy “The Princess Bride.” As the ’80s wore on, Andre was still an integral part of WWE’s national expansion. During the early part of the decade, he battled against Big John Studd, a rivalry that reached its zenith at the first WrestleManiain 1985 when Andre and Studd met in the Body Slam Challenge, which Andre won. The following year, he took part in the Chicago portion of WrestleMania 2, winning the NFL vs. WWE Battle Royal, and adding to his record for most Battle Royals won.In 1987, Andre shocked the world when he turned on long-time ally Hulk Hogan and allied himself with the villainous Bobby “The Brain” Heenan. The Brain scored Andre his first-ever opportunity at the WWE Championship at WrestleMania III. In front of 93,173 WWE fans in Pontiac, Michigan, Andre’s 15-year winning streak ended when Hulk Hogan slammed him to the mat in a torch-passing moment that ignited a new era in WWE history.At long last, after chasing the title for nearly a year, Andre finally won the WWE Title, but immediately surrendered it to Ted DiBiase. The controversial move set the state for the first-ever WWE Championship tournament, held in Atlantic City, N.J., at WrestleMania IV.Andre continued to experience success in his waning days in WWE, winning the World Tag Team Titles with Haku in 1990, the last title he would ever hold. After losing the tag championship gold at WrestleMania VI, Andre finally turned against Heenan, once again putting himself in the crowd\'s favor. The Eighth Wonder of the World made several cameo appearances over the next few years, but on Jan. 27, 1993, Andre the Giant quietly passed away in his sleep in Paris, France.One year after his passing, Andre was honored by his peers as the first inductee in the newly founded WWE Hall of Fame – a fitting end to a career of a Superstar so great, so monumental, and so larger-than-life itself, that his massive footsteps are permanently imprinted on the WWE Universe.');

Back then, it was simply the Capitol Wrestling Corporation, and Rocca was the star of the show, drawing packed houses throughout the Northeast for Vincent J. McMahon.The reasons were simple. He was the most dynamic performer the business had ever seen up to that point. His arsenal of aerial maneuvers would be considered amazing even by today\'s standards; back then, he was a legitimate phenomenon. Hurricanranas, flying dropkicks, victory rolls and flying body presses dazzled 1950s audiences used to seeing athletes who almost never left their feet. His signature move, the Argentine Backbreaker (known to newer fans as the Human Torture Rack) also brought crowds to a frenzy.The ethnic factor also played a big part. Rocca was of Italian heritage and hailed from Latin America, making him a drawing card for two of the New York area\'s largest populations. His fan following was passionate, as is evidenced by the famous riot that erupted at Madison Square Garden on a night in 1957 when Rocca was busted open by Dick the Bruiser.Rocca began his career as a teenager, training under the legendary Stanislaus Zbyszko. In the United States, he began his career in Texas, but was quickly brought to New York in the late 1940s by Joseph \"Toots\" Mondt, the kingpin of wrestling in the Big Apple. Mondt shared Rocca with other promoters in the region, including a newcomer from Washington, D.C. named Vincent J. McMahon. Eventually, McMahon managed to convince Rocca to join his troupe full-time. This, along with his use of television, allowed McMahon to gain enough leverage to become the major player in the territory.Although Rocca never held a World Championship, it really didn\'t matter. In arenas like Madison Square Garden, he was such a big deal that his matches were always main events, even if the NWA World Champion was also competing on the card; the Argentine acrobat was the man the people came to see. During this period, only Gorgeous George was a bigger star, and on the East Coast Rocca was the uncontested king.In the late 1950s, Rocca formed a partnership with Puerto Rican Superstar Miguel Perez, and the duo became the first holders of the United States Tag Team Championship, the title that would eventually evolve into today\'s World Tag Team Championship.By the time WWE was created as an independent entity outside the NWA in 1963, Rocca had already given way to Bruno Sammartino as the company\'s top Superstar. In the 1970s, he returned to WWE as an announcer, calling the action with a very young Vincent K. McMahon. He did this right up until his untimely death in 1977.Antonino Rocca is sometimes left off lists of the greatest Superstars in WWE history, simply because he was around before the letters were. But Rocca was the first major Superstar promoted by the McMahon family, and no such list would be complete without him. In 1995, then-WWE Champion Diesel posthumously inducted Rocca into the WWE Hall of Fame, cementing his place amongst the elite.');

It was here that the young athlete met Rikidozan — perhaps the most famous Japanese wrestler of all time. The legend, impressed by Antonio\'s strength and athleticism, convinced Inoki to return to Tokyo to join his Japanese Wrestling Association.A natural in the ring, Inoki formed a winning tag team in the JWA with another future legend, Giant Baba, but the talented competitor would find his greatest success in New Japan Pro Wrestling, a promotion he founded in 1972.Over the course of the next two decades, Inoki built NJPW into the most successful wrestling company in Asia. Utilizing talented Japanese competitors like Tatsumi Fujinami and Riki Choshu, innovative high-flyers like Tiger Mask and Dynamite Kid and American Superstars like Bob Backlund and Vader, the young promoter created a product that was unique, influential and far ahead of its time. In addition to running the company, Inoki himself was one of the top stars in NJPW, carrying the championship and battling the likes of Stan Hansen, Tiger Jeet Singh and Hulk Hogan.Inoki\'s most famous bout, however, took place on June 26, 1976 in Tokyo when he took on fighting legend Muhammad Ali in a rare wrestler vs. boxer match. By most accounts, the contest was uneventful — Inoki spent much of the bout on the ground kicking at Ali\'s legs — but it paved the way for the advent of Mixed Martial Arts, which would explode in popularity decades later. More importantly, the bout exemplified Inoki\'s undying love and respect for professional wrestling. This passion for competition earned him the nickname \"Moeru Toukon\" amongst his peers, which translates to \"The fighting spirit that burns.\" In fact, Inoki is so revered in the fight world that grapplers actually request to be slapped in the face by the man in hopes of receiving some of his courage. This admiration was felt so deeply in his native Japan that Inoki was elected to the country\'s House of Councillors in 1989. During his time in office, Inoki represented his nation in meetings with the likes of Fidel Castro and Saddam Hussein.Inoki was also an ambassador for professional wrestling, bringing major events to places like Russia and China. In 1995, Inoki battled Ric Flair in Pyongyang, North Korea, in the main event of a festival that drew one of the largest live crowds ever to witness a professional wrestling bout. His retirement match, held on April 4, 1998 at the Tokyo Dome, drew more than 70,000 fans.Just as those spectators paid tribute to the former IWGP Heavyweight Champion\'s amazing legacy, WWE did the same by welcoming Antonio Inoki into the WWE Hall of Fame Class of 2010.');

In 1967, at just 20 years old, he became the youngest ever Mr. Universe. Moving to the United States the following year, he began training at the world-famous Gold’s Gym in Venice, California under IFBB co-founder Joe Weider. Two years later, Schwarzenegger won his first of seven Mr. Olympia titles. He met WWE mega star Bruno Sammartino at Mr. Olympia, and the two became lifelong friends. The Arnold Classic, an annual bodybuilding competition, recognizes Schwarzenegger’s iconic career in the sport.In the 1980s, Arnold conquered the world of cinema, beginning with a starmaking turn in “Conan the Barbarian.” He followed that up with “The Terminator,” which has become perhaps the most noteworthy science-fiction action film in history. The rest of Schwarzenegger’s filmography reads like a history of movies, including “Predator,” “Total Recall” and “True Lies.” He also showed off his comedic chops in “Twins,” “Kindergarten Cop” and “Junior.” A proven versatile performer with massive international appeal, his films have grossed approximately $4.5 billion worldwide.In 2003, Arnold continued living the American dream when he was elected Governor of California, following in the footsteps of fellow movie star Ronald Reagan. Almost instantly christened “The Governator” thanks to his most famous film role, Schwarzenegger led his adopted state through 2010. Throughout his tenure as governor, he declined the salary of the office.Schwarzenegger’s involvement with WWE dates back to becoming friends with both Sammartino and “Superstar” Billy Graham more than 40 years ago, and co-starring with Jesse “The Body” Ventura in “The Running Man” and the aforementioned “Predator.” On an episode of SmackDown in November of 1999, Mr. McMahon presented the “World Box Office Championship” — represented by a replica WWE Title — to Arnold, who then laid out Triple H with a series of vicious punches. In 2013, he inducted his longtime friend Bruno Sammartino into the WWE Hall of Fame in Madison Square Garden.

He quickly earned the nickname \"The Golden Boy,\" known as someone who used his speed and toughness to his advantage. Skaaland\'s career took him all around the world, and he nearly dethroned multiple NWA World Champions. In 1962, his travels brought him to Japan, where he was the referee for a famous match between fellow Hall of Famer Freddie Blassie and Japanese sumo star Rikidozan.In 1963, Skaaland became part of Vince McMahon, Sr.\'s newly-formed sports-entertainment company. It was at that point that his career took a multi-faceted turn. While he was a successful grappler (Skaaland and Spiros Arion held the old United States Tag Team Championship in 1967), he was also a shareholder in McMahon\'s Capitol Wrestling Corporation. When the CWC morphed into the WWE, Skaaland became responsible for producing shows at the Westchester County Center in his home area of White Plains, N.Y.Skaaland also moved into managing, leading the careers of both Bruno Sammartino and Bob Backlund during their reigns as WWE Champion. He also managed Tony Parisi in the 1960s (in fact replacing Parisi as Arion\'s partner during their U.S. Tag Team Title reign), and managed Andre the Giant while both were in Japan. However, Skaaland retired from active competition after leading Backlund to the WWE Championship, and their partnership would lead to perhaps the most infamous moment of Skaaland\'s career.In December 1983, The Iron Sheik challenged Backlund for the WWE Championship. The champion was suffering from a neck injury, and when Sheik trapped Backlund in the dreaded Camel Clutch, Skaaland threw in the towel to prevent any further damage to his client\'s neck. Backlund lost the gold, and soon thereafter, Skaaland left ringside for good. He would later pop up again in 1987, playing a construction foreman alongside several WWE Superstars in the music video for The Wrestling Album 2\'s title track, \"Piledriver.\"A decade later, it was Backlund who would induct Skaaland as part of the first full WWE Hall of Fame class. However, just weeks later, Backlund attacked his former manager in the midst of becoming one of the most hated men in WWE.On March 13, 2007, Skaaland died in Westchester County, N.Y., with his wife Betty by his side. Several colleagues paused to remember Skaaland, who longtime friend and rival Captain Lou Albano called \"the most loyal man I\'ve ever met\" on the World\'s Greatest Wrestling Managers DVD.He was a loyal friend, a trusted business partner, a talented grappler and brilliant managerial mind; it is these traits that make him worthy of being enshrined in the WWE Hall of Fame.');

He made an instant impact, knocking out opponent after opponent with a devastating enzuigiri he dubbed the “Ghetto Blaster.”Bad News preferred to keep to himself, making no friends. Even the most evil of WWE Superstars couldn’t warm up to Brown.

But when the bell rang, there was nothing suave about the Baron, who frequently victimized opponents with a roll of coins.Scicluna began his sports-entertainment career as Mike Valentino, spending most of his career in Canada. In 1965, he came south of the border to join WWE, where he reverted to his given name (complete with royal prefix).During his time in WWE, Scicluna became a master at using (and hiding) foreign objects, most notably his aforementioned roll of coins. Only rarely did referees ever catch on to Scicluna\'s deceptions, and he used them to his advantage.During his career, Scicluna\'s biggest successes came as a tag team wrestler. Shortly after entering WWE, Scicluna won the United States Tag Team Championship with Smasher Sloan in 1966; six years later, he and King Curtis Iaukea captured the World Tag Team Championship. He also teamed up with fellow Hall of Famer George \"The Animal\" Steele (mainly in the Pittsburgh area) during his career, and the two were a notable thorn in the side of Steel City native Bruno Sammartino.In between, Scicluna established himself as a recurrent threat to Sammartino and Pedro Morales during their reigns as WWE Champion, coming close but never winning the gold. His most famous moment, however, perhaps came in 1976, when he was Gorilla Monsoon\'s opponent the night boxing legend Muhammad Ali stormed the ring (and subsequently fell victim to Monsoon\'s Airplane Spin).Scicluna\'s career continued into the mid-1980s, where he was often seen on WWE television before retiring in 1984. A dozen years after his retirement, Scicluna was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame; fittingly, it was Monsoon who put the Baron into the Hall, putting a Gorilla-sized stamp on the legacy of the man from the Isle of Malta.');

He cannot undo becoming estranged from his parents by age 17 or the assault charges he accrued and probation he served for unleashing his ferocious temper on two unruly patrons at a club where Batista worked as a bouncer.But rather than let his past pull him down, Batista rose above it by setting a goal of becoming an athlete and entertainer. He trained under Afa at the Wild Samoan Training Centre in Allentown, Pa. and redoubled his efforts after a WCW scout told Batista he’d never make it — only to find himself thriving in the independent circuit shortly thereafter. Two years later, WWE finally came calling.And in 2002, Batista answered that call in a beastly way. With a bit of refinement from Evolution colleagues Triple H and Ric Flair, The Animal developed from a self-described “muscleheaded goofball” to a six-time World Heavyweight Champion. His first World Heavyweight Championship win came at the expense of Triple H at WrestleMania 21 and lasted 282 days, which still stands as a WWE record for longest single reign in that title’s history. His resume includes winning two Royal Rumble Matches, handing Triple H his first loss in a Hell in a Cell Match at Vengeance in 2005, and wins over The Undertaker, John Cena and Randy Orton.Batista departed WWE in 2010, but returned in January 2014 and immediately won the 30-Man Royal Rumble Match to earn a WWE World Heavyweight Title opportunity at WrestleMania 30. The Animal tapped out to Daniel Bryan in the Triple Threat main event, but the loss did little to curb his ego. In the weeks that followed, the arrogant Batista realigned himself with Triple H and The Viper in a reformation of their Evolution grouping. Together, the trio looked to take out The Shield.However at Extreme Rules, Evolution was ultimately defeated in a showdown with The Hounds of Justice — an incredible battle between two of the most dominant factions in WWE history. Then, at WWE Payback, Rollins, Ambrose & Reigns shut out all three members of the legendary faction in a brutal No Holds Barred Elimination Match.One night later on Raw, frustrated that he never got the one-on-one WWE World Heavyweight Championship Match he earned by winning the 2014 Royal Rumble Match, Batista abandoned his Evolution associates and quit WWE. ');

The 300-plus pounder muscled around his foes like he would an unruly prisoner, before handcuffing them to the ropes and introducing them to the business end of his trusty nightstick. By 1989, The Slickster saw dollar signs in his eyes when he paired up his crooked cop with Akeem, The African Dream.

In a Jailhouse Match at SummerSlam 1991, he sent the crooked Canadian copper off to one of New York City’s roughest correctional facilities, ensuring he’d know what life was like behind bars.Though he was on the straight and narrow, his past came to haunt him in the form of Nailz, a former convict who claimed The Big Boss Man had brutalized him behind bars.  The officer was viciously assaulted by the prisoner, putting him out of action for several weeks. When he recovered, cop and convict squared off in a Nightstick Match, where the convict was vanquished.Big Boss Man returned to WWE in 1998, eschewing his policeman’s blues for riot squad black as he took on the role of bodyguard of Mr. McMahon in his heated rivalry with “Stone Cold” Steve Austin. This time, the former corrections officer showed he had no morals whatsoever, stooping to new lows with each passing week during WWE\'s Attitude Era.

As the masked Executioners, he & Kowalski made a quick impact, winning the World Tag Team Championship that year. He also competed without the mask during this time as well, using the name Chuck O\'Connor.After leaving WWE, Minton moved to the Mid-Atlantic region, where he competed as Masked Superstar #2. It was during this time that he first hooked up with future WWE teammate Ken Patera, as the duo won the Mid-Atlantic Tag Team Championship in 1978. But after losing a match to Blackjack Mulligan, he was forced to unmask and began competing under his most famous moniker, Big John Studd.In the early 1980s, Studd spent time in Florida, the AWA and NWA before returning to WWE. Originally managed by Freddie Blassie, Studd later became a member of the Heenan Family, engaging in a long and storied rivalry with Andre the Giant over who was the \"true giant\" of WWE. Their rivalry produced two of the most infamous moments in WWE history.In December 1984, Studd, along with Patera and Heenan, cut Andre\'s hair during a tag team match. A few months later at the inaugural WrestleMania in New York City\'s famed Madison Square Garden, Andre and Studd made history by competing in a $15,000 Bodyslam Challenge. In one of the first of many great WrestleMania moments, Andre slammed Studd and collected the bounty, but Heenan stole it back before he could toss the money to the crowd. Later in 1985, Studd and fellow Heenan Family member King Kong Bundy formed a regular tag team, clashing with the likes of Andre & Hulk Hogan on a regular basis.The following year, Studd was part of another great WrestleMania moment when he competed in the WWE/NFL Battle Royal at WrestleMania 2. The Battle Royal was during the Chicago portion of the show, and Studd drew the crowd\'s ire when he eliminated Chicago Bears great (and future fellow Hall of Famer) William \"The Refrigerator\" Perry from the Battle Royal. Perry then extended his hand to Studd, but when the giant reached out to shake it, Perry pulled him over the top rope to eliminate him as well.Studd left WWE shortly after, but returned two years later and once again rekindled his rivalry with Andre. This time, however, the Frenchman was under the tutelage of the hated Heenan, so the fans rallied to Studd\'s side. In perhaps the crowning achievement in his WWE career, Studd entered the 1989 Royal Rumble Match at No. 27 and last eliminated Ted DiBiase to win the match. Later that year, he would be the guest referee for Andre\'s bout with Jake Roberts at WrestleMania V. Before their issue could be settled, however, Studd once again left WWE in mid-1989, this time for good.Over the next few years, Studd helped train a few grapplers for the squared circle; most notable was Ron Reis, who competed in WCW as \"Big\" Ron Studd in tribute to his mentor. He also dabbled in Hollywood, appearing in episodes of \"The A-Team\" and \"Hunter,\" as well as in movies such as \"Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man.\" Sadly, however, John Minton passed away on March 20, 1995, due to complications from liver cancer and Hodgkin\'s disease.In 2004, on the night before WrestleMania XX, Studd was posthumously inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in the same city where he made WrestleMania history two decades earlier. Another great giant, Big Show, inducted Studd into the Hall, and son John Minton Jr. accepted the Hall of Fame plaque on behalf of his dad.In his career, Studd was a World Tag Team Champion, WrestleMania participant and Royal Rumble winner; his induction into the Hall of Fame, however, affirmed that Studd was one of sports-entertainment\'s true giants.');

Up until that point in his career, onlookers recognized his talent, but the Allenton, Pa. native had limited success. But after joining the Flock and later as a member of the Filthy Animals and the New Blood, he had several rivalries, most notably with Juventud Guerrera, Rey Mysterio and even scored a pinfall against Hulk Hogan! Kidman and Guerrera traded the Cruiserweight Championship several times and he was a versatile tag team partner, winning the WCW Tag Team Championships with Mysterio and then Konnan.Kidman was signed by WWE after WCW folded in 2001 and made an immediate impact, winning the Cruiserweight Championship from Gregory Helms. He along with Mysterio and Chavo Guerrero, were responsible for the resurgence of the Cruiserweight division in WWE. Kidman amazed sports-entertainment fans in his wars over the Cruiserweight Championship with X-Pac, Tajiri and Jamie Noble. In addition, he continued to excel in tag team competition, capturing the WWE Tag Team Championship with Paul London.After retiring from the ring in 2004, Kidman became a Producer for WWE and is seated behind the video wall of WWE\'s entrance stage at Raw, SmackDown and all pay-per-views on WWE Network.');

In both respects, he has been revered as a man of honor.Born in the Atlanta suburb of Marietta, Ga., in the autumn of 1939, Armstrong craved action from a young age. In his teens, he served in the United States Marine Corps in Korea. When his service ended, he became a firefighter. But his dream was always to enter the ring and he did so beginning in the mid-60s. Armstrong was by no means an overnight success, but he was hardworking and dedicated and by the end of the decade he\'d built a strong fan following in the South.The crowds who lined up to watch the grappler in arenas throughout Alabama and Georgia saw something of themselves in Armstrong. He wasn\'t the biggest man in the ring and he wasn\'t flashy, but he had tenacity. It was this “never say die” spirit that helped Armstrong persevere when a weightlifting accident nearly disfigured him. Instead of sulking on the sidelines, he pulled on a mask and became \"The Bullet.\" His popularity only grew.What endeared Armstrong with his fans the most was the fact that he was a true southerner. Although the talented competitor was often lured by big paydays “up north,” he was too much of a good old boy to be tempted by the bright lights of New York City or Chicago. He made his greatest mark in promotions like Southeastern Championship Wrestling and Georgia Championship Wrestling. It was where he felt at home and where he felt connected to the people.A dedicated family man, Armstrong and his beloved wife, Gail, raised four sons — Brad, Scott, Steve and Brian. Physical like their father, the boys would all grow up to become sports-entertainers. Brian is best known as \"The Road Dogg\" Jesse James, a former member of DX and one of the most popular Superstars of WWE’s “Attitude Era.” Brad and Steve both found success in World Championship Wrestling. Scott was a WCW competitor as well and later made his mark as one of WWE’s top officials. All of the Armstrong boys are highly respected as talented performers by their peers, which shouldn\'t come as a surprise. The Bullet trained all of them. Over the years, Armstrong also had the opportunity to team with each of his sons and won championships with them on many occasions.Amazingly, The Bullet still gets in the ring with his sons to this day. Although he’s understandably slowed a bit with age, he can lace up the boots and dish out a Georgia Jaw Jacker when he needs to.

The kid from Princeton, Minn., quickly became a fan favorite and the seventh WWE Champion in the company’s history at Madison Square Garden in 1978. But when Backlund left WWE for good in the mid-1990s, he was a deranged madman despised by the fans for his outlandish behavior. It was a stunning transformation for the once beloved man who reigned atop sports-entertainment in the pre-Hogan era.Backlund was a television staple after arriving in WWE thanks to his boyish demeanor and superior talent, and on Feb. 20, 1978, he achieved what few before him had ever done and won the WWE Championship by defeating the flamboyant “Superstar” Billy Graham. A former athletic standout at North Dakota State University – where he won the NCAA Division II heavyweight wrestling championship – Backlund had the rare combination of good looks, pure strength and technical skill.The list of opponents’ that succumbed to Backlund during his reign reads like a who’s who of wrestling greats, including Sgt. Slaughter, Greg Valentine, Antonio Inoki, Don Muraco and Jimmy Snuka. He even defended the title against other promotions’ top dogs including the NWA’s Harley Race and Ric Flair and the AWA’s Nick Bockwinkel.By the early \'80s, pop culture was changing and so was WWE. Backlund lost the WWE Championship to The Iron Sheik while trapped in the Camel Clutch in Madison Square Garden. Backlund never submitted, but his manager Arnold Skaaland opted to throw in the towel to avoid permanent injury. Three weeks later, Hulk Hogan became champion and Backlund quietly left WWE.After a decade, Backlund made an unexpected return in 1992. At this point, WWE had undergone many changes, and Backlund\'s boy-next-door looks didn\'t receive the same reaction they once had. After losing a highly anticipated WWE Championship opportunity against Bret Hart, Backlund snapped and became Mister Backlund, a bowtie-wearing, dictionary-toting madman who enraged the WWE Universe. He assaulted WWE personalities with the Crossface Chickenwing, including Skaaland, who Backlund blamed for his title loss 10 years prior. The devastating hold put even the most talented Superstars in muscle-stretching agony, and has been known to literally tear men apart.Backlund received another opportunity at Hart’s WWE Championship at 1994’s Survivor Series in a “Throw in the Towel” Match. In spectacular irony, Backlund regained the WWE Championship the same way he had lost it 11 years earlier. With the “Hit Man” locked in the Chickenwing for more than eight minutes, Bret’s mother played the role of Skaaland and threw in the towel. He might have been more “eat your broccoli” than American apple pie, but Mr. Backlund was once again the champ.The three total days of his second reign did not quite match Backlund’s first six-year run with the title. Backlund slowly ended his in-ring career, had a memorable run for President of the United States in 1995, and briefly managed another American hero, Kurt Angle.Backlund’s impressive run at the top and subsequent descent into absurd lunacy makes for one of the most unique careers in WWE history.

The second generation Superstar attempted to wallop Mr. T to help Piper and Orndorff get the win, but he missed and hit Orndorff instead, leading to Hollywood Hogan and Mr. T picking up the first main event win in WrestleMania history.Orton, whose son Randy Orton is currently making a name for himself in WWE, turned the simple plaster cast into one of the most deadly foreign objects in WWE history. Orton, who injured his arm during the mid 1980s, was forced to wear a cast to help his arm heal. But unlike most people who have their cast removed after a period of a few months or so, Orton milked the injury and wore the cast for a few years! Orton convinced officials that the cast was needed to help his arm heal, and every chance he got, he used it as a weapon to lay out his opponents.Orton is probably best known for his time as one of Piper\'s closest allies. Not only did he stand in the corner of Piper at the first WrestleMania, he was also Hot Rod\'s corner man for his boxing match against Mr. T at WrestleMania 2. But once Piper became a fan favorite, Orton just couldn\'t bring himself to follow. Instead, he swore his allegiance to \"Adorable\" Adrian Adonis and traded in his classic style cowboy hat for a more flamboyant pink one.Orton also formed an imposing tag team with Hall of Famer Don Muraco. The tandem actually opened WrestleMania III from the Pontiac Silverdome. The duo squared off against the Can-Am Connection and helped get the record-breaking crowd into a frenzy, even though they came up short in the match.Ace, as he later came to be known, was also one of the first Superstars to utilize the ropes for his finishing maneuver. Although it\'s used with a lot more frequency today, Orton was one of the first wrestlers to use the Superplex as his finishing maneuver. It was very uncommon to see the Superstars of Orton\'s day go to the ropes to finish off an opponent, making the maneuver one of the most deadly of his day.

While the Wisconsin native has always been self-deprecating about his pro stats (\"I was once named Minor League Player of the Year. Unfortunately, I had been in the majors for two years at the time,\" he once cracked.), he was actually a solid defensive performer and helped the St. Louis Cardinals capture a World Series Championship in 1964.Still, Mr. Baseball\'s greatest success came after he hung up his cleats. Due to his quick wit and wry sense of humor, Uecker was brought on as the Milwaukee Brewers radio play-by-play announcer in 1971 — a position he holds to this day. His affable personality won him many fans, including Johnny Carson who invited Uecker onto \"The Tonight Show\" more than 50 times.

Heenan plied his trade as their mischievous manager by running his mouth on their behalf with a sarcastic wit considered among the best in the business – and by often weaseling out of facing the inevitable consequences.WWE Superstars under Heenan’s guidance came to be known as the Heenan Family, a moniker meant to show the strength of their alliance over the average stable. (Heenan also disliked the lowly “stable” description that he felt was “A place where you keep a bunch of fly-infested horses.”) Members of the Heenan Family need no introduction, as they include such legends as AWA Champion Nick Bockwinkel, the Blackjacks, Big John Studd, King Kong Bundy, \"Ravishing\" Rick Rude, \"Mr. Perfect\" Curt Hennig, the Brain Busters (Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard), Harley Race, and of course, the first WWE Hall of Famer, Andre the Giant -- whom Heenan led to the ring at WrestleMania III before 93,173 Humanoids (Heenan’s nickname for the WWE Universe) at the Pontiac Silverdome in 1987.For all the bravado Heenan brought to the managerial ranks, he made himself louder and prouder as an announcer. The self-proclaimed “broadcast journalist” regularly played favorites during matches he called and argued frequently with announcing partner and longtime friend Gorilla Monsoon in a pairing that rivaled the likes of Abbott & Costello for humor and chemistry.  He was part of the original broadcast team for Monday Night RAW in 1993, and is the only person to have sat at the announcer’s table for both RAW and WCW Monday Nitro.

African-Americans looked at him as a role model, and even spectators with racist attitudes couldn\'t contain themselves from leaping to their feet and cheering for the popular Superstar. Many have even referred to Brazil as the \"Jackie Robinson of sports-entertainment\" in response to the way Brazil and Robinson similarly broke down racial barriers in their respective sports.Brazil, who hailed from Benton Harbor, Mich., debuted in 1951 after training with Joe Savoldi. Originally, he was to go by the name \"Boo Boo\" Brazil, but when a promoter made a printing mistake on an advertisement, he became Bobo Brazil and the name stuck.Brazil made perhaps his biggest fame in the local Detroit area, where he became one of the biggest rivals of local legend and promoter and fellow WWE Hall of Famer The Sheik. Brazil and The Sheik drew each other\'s blood for decades, often times trading a version of the United States Championship back and forth in Michigan, Ohio and Ontario.While life in Detroit may have seemed good for Brazil, it was tough elsewhere around the country. In Brazil\'s time, black fans were forced to sit in separate sections from white devotees at certain venues, and Brazil was banned from many hotels and restaurants. He handled this adversity with a dignity that inspired many of his peers to discover the same qualities in themselves.A number of promoters would only book African-Americans against other African-Americans, fearing that any other combination could lead to race riots. Brazil thrived in these types of confrontations, beating back dangerous foes like Abdullah the Butcher and Ernie \"The Cat\" Ladd.But the fans refused to settle for watching Bobo compete against a limited repertoire of opponents, and the promoters were forced to respond. Brazil was willing to take on virtually anyone. Although he spent the majority of his career as an enormously well-liked wrestler, he had no qualms about mixing it up with the other so-called \"good guys.\" On at least one occasion, he fought to a draw with Andre the Giant -- an impressive exploit, considering their size difference. In 1970, however, Brazil made history when he teamed with El Mongol to defeat Mr. Ito & The Great Ota in the first racially-mixed match in Atlanta sports-entertainment history.Bobo also had memorable skirmishes with such stars as Dick the Bruiser, Johnny Valentine, Haystacks Calhoun and Killer Kowalski. Despite his friendly demeanor outside the ring, Brazil was a tireless brawler who seemed to invite his opponents to break the rules in order to counter their maneuvers with his own arsenal. It was also universally acknowledged that Brazil had the hardest head in the sport, toppling rivals with his storied \"Coco Butt.\"Further proving that he would take on anyone, Brazil was one of the rare fan favorites to challenge Bruno Sammartino for the WWE Championship throughout the northeastern United States in the 1960s. Fans were often mixed in reactions to these clashes, cheering both combatants. Washington, D.C., in particular, was a stronghold of Brazil fans. There, fellow Hall of Famer James Dudley, a WWE insider remembered for being the first African-American to run a major arena, would fire up the crowd by jogging to the ring, waving a towel as Bobo trotted behind him. After a particularly strenuous match with Brazil in Washington, \"Classy\" Freddie Blassie theorized that the fans would have committed murder, had Bobo asked.But Brazil achieved success everywhere he went, holding numerous regional NWA championships in the Detroit, Toronto, Florida, San Francisco and Mid-Atlantic regions throughout his career. He once held the United States Championship in the Mid-Atlantic region (a title that eventually evolved into the WWE United States Championship) and nearly toppled fellow 1994 inductee Buddy Rogers for the NWA World Championship in 1962.Brazil retired in the 1990s after four decades in sports-entertainment, and his life after the squared circle was just as successful. He served as an advisor and mentor to Rocky Johnson in the 1980s, and in Benton Harbor, his restaurant, Bobo\'s Grill, became a local landmark.In 1994, Brazil was given the ultimate honor when he was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. He was inducted by longtime rival Ernie Ladd, and just one year later, Brazil got to return the favor when he inducted Ladd into the Hall of Fame. Sadly, however, Brazil passed away on January 20, 1998 at the age of 73.Throughout his 40-plus years in sports-entertainment, Bobo Brazil was a fan favorite, a champion, and most importantly, a pioneer for future African-Americans in sports-entertainment.');

He was also an innovator of offense and possessed an uncanny ability to create pinning combinations out of seemingly any predicament.Hart emerged from Calgary\'s Stampede Wrestling, coming to WWE as a tag team with his brother-in-law, Jim \"The Anvil\" Neidhart. Together, The Hart Foundation won the World Tag Team Titles twice, and became one of the most popular pairings in WWE.From there, The Hart Foundation separated, and Bret became and instant sensation as a singles star. He defeated Mr. Perfect for the Intercontinental Championship in August if 1991, and became a two-time holder of the title at WrestleMania VIII, where he defeated “Rowdy” Roddy Piper in a memorable match-up.Hart won his first WWE Championship in a non-televised live event in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, forcing Ric Flair to submit to the Sharpshooter. It began the first of five WWE Title reigns for the man who boldly declared, \"I\'m the best there is, the best there was, and the best there ever will be.\"The win began a stellar run for The Hit Man. He won King of the Ring in 1993, the Royal Rumble in 1994, and defeated Yokozuna for the WWE Title at WrestleMania X. At the time, he also began a well-documented rivalry with Shawn Michaels, which would ultimately lead to one of the biggest matches in WrestleMania history — WrestleMania XII’s Iron Man Match, and ultimately the most infamous moment in WWE history, The “Montreal Screwjob.”It was the 1997 Survivor Series, and Hart was scheduled to leave WWE for rival WCW, while embroiled in a dispute with Mr. McMahon over the fate of the WWE Title. That evening, Shawn Michaels administered the champion’s own Sharpshooter, referee Earl Hebner called for the bell and HBK was awarded the WWE Championship. On the wrong end of a well-devised conspiracy, The Excellence of Execution was furious, and left WWE dejected.In WCW, Hart never attained the same level of success he enjoyed in WWE. And a severe injury suffered in 2000, coupled with a stroke in 2002, forced him to retire from fulltime in-ring competition.But just as the wounds left from the Montreal incident appeared incurable, in 2010, Hart surprisingly returned to WWE. While he achieved closure with HBK, he also reignited an unsettled, personal rivalry with McMahon, culminating with Hart\'s return to action at WrestleMania XXVI where The Hit Man, flanked by many members of his family, finally confronted his biggest enemy.Hart ultimately defeated his nemesis in brutal fashion, finishing the final chapter of a Hall of Famer career, worthy of being called “the best there ever will be.”');

It was in the Great White North that Pillman found his calling. Under the tutelage of the legendary Stu Hart, Pillman began his career in Stampede Wrestling, honing his craft and earning two tag team championships with Bruce Hart before joining WCW in 1989.During his time competing for the Atlanta-based organization, Pillman began to set himself apart from the other competitors. Just as Shawn Michaels utilized fast-paced and high-flying maneuvers in WWE, the Cincinnati native did the same in WCW, delighting fans with an aerial offense unheard of at the time and earning himself the moniker “Flyin’ ” Brian.Pillman also formed a memorable alliance with “Stunning” Steve Austin and the duo became known as The Hollywood Blonds. The former WCW Tag Team Champions were popular for their brazen attitudes and desire to be the best competitors in WCW — characteristics of both competitors throughout their careers.In the midst of a stint with a reformed version of The Four Horsemen, Pillman’s “Loose Cannon” persona emerged. Once a clean-cut and charismatic highflier, the Cincinnati native became outspoken with both his words and actions, much to chagrin of his fellow Horsemen. Pillman also drastically changed his wardrobe, a transformation that highlighted the radical evolution of his persona. No one ever knew what the “Loose Cannon” was going to say or do, and revealing confidential information about WCW’s management eventually cost him his job.Although injured and volatile, he was the top free agent in sports-entertainment when he joined WWE in June 1996. Still in recovery, the Loose Cannon began his tenure as an announcer before returning to full-time competition. Though he initially reformed his alliance with Austin, the former WCW Light Heavyweight Champion eventually joined with his former Stampede Wrestling colleagues Bret “Hit Man” Hart, Jim “The Anvil” Neidhart, The British Bulldog and Owen Hart in the pro-Canadian Hart Foundation. The Hart Dungeon had a heated rivalry with “Stone Cold,” before focusing on Goldust and his manager, Marlena.Brian Pillman passed away in 1997, but he is remembered as one of the most influential Superstars of the 1990s.

He won the NCAA Division I collegiate wrestling championship as a senior at the University of Minnesota, the WWE Championship within six months of his debut and the UFC Heavyweight Title in his fourth professional MMA fight. He’s also The One in 22-1. Plain and simple, the man was built to destroy.First scouted by WWE officials while smashing his way through the college wrestling ranks, Lesnar debuted on Raw March 18, 2002, and singlehandedly destroyed a ring full of unfortunate Superstars. From that night on, the domination was unrepentant. With the sinister Paul Heyman guiding his career, “The Next Big Thing” won the King of the Ring tournament and beat The Rock to win the WWE Title — becoming the youngest WWE Champion in history at that time, and the fastest rising star sports-entertainment had ever seen.The freight-train momentum of Lesnar didn’t even stall one bit after a layoff of nearly 10 years; when The Beast’s sojourn in UFC ended, he returned to WWE in 2012 firing on all cylinders, battling the very best WWE has to offer and achieving the impossible at WrestleMania 30: Becoming the first (and only) Superstar to defeat The Undertaker on The Grandest Stage of Them All. Lesnar returned to UFC to fight Mark Hunt at UFC 200, defeating the heavyweight by decision, then followed up with a TKO victory against Randy Orton at SummerSlam.As if the pure ability of Lesnar isn’t enough to make him the most imposing Superstar in WWE history, the presence of Paul Heyman singing his praises (sometimes literally) builds the myth of The Beast Incarnate even as he writes it.

And they will be telling the truth.What made Brody so threatening? It may have been the fact that no one was safe when the madman was in action. Adopting a wild, freewheeling brawling style long before the dawn of hardcore wrestling, Brody attacked opponents, referees and fans with equal disregard. But Brody’s tangled hair, feral beard and furred boots often — and intentionally — belied the bright, talented family man underneath the animal exterior.A college football player at the fabled West Texas State University, Brody struggled to break into the NFL before stumbling into professional wrestling under the name Frank “The Hammer” Goodish. His 6-foot-8, 300-pound frame made him a star from the very beginning, but the big man’s career began to build steam in 1976 when he arrived in WWE and was rechristened Bruiser Brody. Finding his persona as an intelligent monster, Brody took his show on the road, becoming the top independent wrestler in the world during the 1980s.Fiercely self-reliant, Brody refused to stay in one territory for long, preferring to rampage across the globe in search of bigger paydays and tougher competition. He battled Dick the Bruiser in Indianapolis over the rights to the name “Bruiser,” terrified Lex Luger in an infamous Steel Cage Match in Florida and fought Abdullah the Butcher in every corner of the globe in one of wrestling’s goriest rivalries.

After setting a world record in 1959 by bench-pressing 565 pounds, Sammartino caught the eye of Mr. McMahon’s father, Vincent J. McMahon, and went pro almost instantly.Bruno became an overnight sensation, connecting with not only fellow Italians, but also Latinos, Greeks and Jews, successfully bridging the gap in America’s melting pot of wrestling fans. His legend continued to grow on May 17, 1963, when Sammartino defeated Buddy Rogers in just 48 seconds to become the second-ever WWE Champion in front of nearly 20,000 fans at the old Madison Square Garden.Bruno held the WWE Championship for nearly eight years, by far the longest reign of all time, and a record for all professional wrestling champions, no matter the organization.

But the inaugural WWE Champion seemed to care little about how he was perceived. He legitimately was great, and even his harshest detractors could do nothing to change that.Rogers was a former Camden, N.J., police officer who began his career by competing as Herman Rohde in New Jersey in 1939. When he later moved on to Texas, however, he transformed into the \"Nature Boy,\" bleaching his hair and taking his nickname from a popular jazz song. With his platinum blond locks, rich tan, haughty strut and signature Figure-Four Leglock, Rogers stood out.His services were sought all over the country, and are credited with galvanizing businesses in struggling promotions. His 1961 match with O\'Connor set attendance and gate records that would not be surpassed for two decades. But Rogers was considered a difficult person by many peers, and was continuously embroiled in controversy.In addition to being NWA World Champion, Rogers competed in Vincent J. McMahon\'s Capitol Wrestling Corporation in the 1950s and 1960s, twice winning the United States Tag Team Championship. In fact, it would be McMahon who would lead Rogers to a moment that will forever live in sports-entertainment lore.In early 1963, Rogers lost the NWA Championship to Lou Thesz in Toronto. While most promotions in the United States recognized the title change, McMahon and partner Toots Mondt cried foul. They insisted that the NWA Title could only change hands in a two-out-of-three falls match, and declared the result of the single-fall contest invalid. In fact, they claimed that Rogers had won a tournament to become the titlist of their new company, WWE.Rogers did not wear the crown for long, however. On May 17, 1963, Bruno Sammartino defeated him in 48 seconds in Madison Square Garden to claim the title. Rogers claimed he\'d suffered a heart attack shortly before the match, but Sammartino claims the dethroned king was simply making excuses.After the loss, Rogers vanished from sight, turning up briefly in different promotions but disappearing almost as quickly. Then, in 1979, he appeared in North Carolina, heckling and then attacking a new \"Nature Boy,\" Ric Flair, in the Mid-Atlantic wrestling territory.During his time there, Rogers would manage such Superstars as Jimmy \"Superfly\" Snuka, Ken Patera and Big John Studd, but it was his rivalry with Flair that is most notable.The \"Battle of the Nature Boys\" was a pivotal moment in Flair\'s career. \"Slick Ric\" admitted to emulating many of Rogers\' mannerisms and ring moves, and when Flair defeated his idol with a Figure-Four Leglock in Greensboro, N.C., in 1978, he earned the right to proclaim that \"To be The Man, you have to beat The Man.\"In the early 1980s, Rogers returned to WWE. Originally hosting an interview segment called \"Rogers\' Corner\" on WWE programming, Rogers found himself soon in the corner of Snuka once again. In an example of enterprising journalism, Rogers discovered that Captain Lou Albano had misappropriated funds due to Snuka; \"Superfly\" later turned against Albano, becoming one of the most popular Superstars in WWE almost overnight.  Rogers was firmly in his corner, even occasionally showing traces of the old \"Nature Boy\" when they paired up in tag team bouts. However, after breaking his hip in a tag team match with Snuka against Albano & Ray Stevens, Rogers retired for good.Amazingly, Rogers almost returned to the ring one final time in 1992. The 71-year-old Rogers was set to face off against another impostor \"Nature Boy,\" Buddy Landell, in Philadelphia, but the match never happened. Sadly, later that year, Rogers passed away due to complications from a heart attack and multiple strokes.In 1994, Rogers was honored posthumously, inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by then-WWE Champion Bret Hart.

With his open Hawaiian shirts, outrageous facial hair and trademark rubber bands hanging from his cheek, Captain Lou may not have looked like much of a success, but his record speaks for itself.Albano was an excellent athlete as a youth, attending the University of Tennessee on a football scholarship. After a stint in the United States Army, he began his sports-entertainment career in Canada in 1953. Albano soon began teaming with Tony Altimore; together they were known as \"The Sicilians.\" After coming to WWE in the 1960s, they defeated the legendary Bruno Sammartino & Spiros Arion to win the WWE United States Tag Team Championship in 1967.After the breakup of The Sicilians, Albano transformed himself into a manager, making it his sole mission to end the lengthy WWE Championship reign of Bruno Sammartino. This made him perhaps the most hated man in the promotion, but in 1971, he accomplished his goal; protégé Ivan Koloff defeated Sammartino in Madison Square Garden to end the Italian champion\'s seven-plus year reign. Koloff\'s reign lasted only three weeks, and despite managing several other Hall of Famers, Koloff was the only World Champion Albano ever managed. He would lead Don Muraco, Greg Valentine and Pat Patterson to the Intercontinental Championship, but never again tasted a World title.Having been a tag team star himself, though, it was in managing duos where Albano excelled. In the span of 20 years, he managed 15 different teams to the World Tag Team Championship, earning the nickname \"The Guiding Light\" and a record that may never be broken. Several of his championship duos featured Hall of Famers, including fellow 1996 Hall of Fame inductees The Valiant Brothers and 2007 inductees The Wild Samoans. Mr. Fuji & Mr. Saito, The Executioners and The Moondogs were just of few of the other teams to become World Tag Team Champions under Captain Lou\'s guidance.After 15 years of being one of the most hated men in sports-entertainment, however, Albano had a change of heart. In 1983, he appeared in Cyndi Lauper\'s music video for \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun,\" and later claimed to be the catalyst to Lauper\'s success. Thus began the legendary \"Rock \'n\' Wrestling\" Era in WWE, which combined with Hulkamania helped launch WWE into a new stratosphere in the mid-1980s. After a lengthy rivalry with the singer (which saw Lauper\'s pal Wendi Richter win the Women\'s Championship from Albano\'s client The Fabulous Moolah), Captain Lou apologized to Lauper and became an instant fan favorite. Once the Rock n\' Wrestling phenomenon began to wind down, Albano led the British Bulldogs to the World Tag Team Championship in 1986 before leaving WWE.In his time away from WWE, Albano capitalized on his newfound celebrity. He appeared in several episodes of shows such as Miami Vice before starring in the film Body Slam alongside fellow Hall of Famer \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper in 1987. Albano also managed and performed with rock group NRBQ, who wrote the song \"Captain Lou\" in his honor. Later, the Captain starred in The Super Mario Bros. Super Show, a hybrid live-action/animated show; Albano played Nintendo legend Mario in the live portion while also voicing his cartoon counterpart.After nearly a decade away from the ring, however, Captain Lou returned for one final hurrah. In 1994, Albano joined former protégé Afa the Wild Samoan as advisor of Samu & Fatu, the Headshrinkers. Together, Albano & Afa had success once more, leading Samu & Fatu to the World Tag Team Championship. The Headshrinkers thus became the final team on Captain Lou\'s legendary list of World Tag Team Champions.In 1996, Albano claimed his rightful place in the pantheon of the elite, the WWE Hall of Fame. Inducted by legendary New York media personality Joe Franklin, Albano was finally truly recognized as one of sports-entertainment\'s elite. He was often imitated but never duplicated, and he certainly will never be forgotten either. ');

Perhaps the greatest Native American to lace up a pair of boots, Chief Jay was one of sports-entertainment\'s most influential and popular grapplers for almost 40 years.Strongbow\'s illustrious career began in 1947. Over the next two decades, he became one of the most successful Superstars in the business, racking up dozens of regional NWA championships in the southern United States. In the late-1960s, he moved on to WWE, where he would become a household name for the following two decades and beyond.Although Strongbow was a talented singles star in his own right, he etched his name in history through his accomplishments in the tag team scene. In May 1972, Strongbow won his first of four World Tag Team Championships, teaming with Sonny King to defeat the rugged tandem of Baron Mikel Scicluna & King Curtis. Although Strongbow & King only held the title for a month, Chief Jay demonstrated that he understood the nuances of the tag team division as well as anyone. It was only a matter of time -- and finding the right partner -- for Strongbow before he would share the title gold again.That time came in 1976 when he and fellow Native American Billy White Wolf defeated The Executioners and Tor Kamata & Nikolai Volkoff in a three-team tournament to win the championship gold. Chief Jay & White Wolf were extremely popular, but their reign was abbreviated in 1977 when they were forced to vacate the titles due to a neck injury suffered by White Wolf.With White Wolf\'s career over, Strongbow decided to focus on his singles career. Years before, he had battled men like Spiros Arion and Jimmy Valiant. Back as a singles combatant, Strongbow embarked on a long-running battle with Greg \"The Hammer\" Valentine, and the two clashed in a memorable and brutal Indian Strap Match in 1979.In the early 1980s, however, Strongbow was called to the tag team ranks once again. This time, it was by blood, as brother Jules Strongbow arrived in WWE, and the Native American duo set their sights on tag team titles. On June 28, 1982, the pair from Pawhuska, Okla., defeated the diabolical Japanese duo of Mr. Fuji & Mr. Saito to win the World Tag Team Championship. They would lose the championship to and regain it from Fuji & Saito later that year before finally succumbing to the Wild Samoans in 1983.Soon after that loss, Chief Jay Strongbow retired from active competition. He remained a vital part of WWE, however, assuming a prominent role in the front office and serving as a mentor to fellow Native American grappler Tatanka in the early-1990s. At one point, Strongbow even presented Tatanka with a sacred Native American headdress as a token of his success. In 1994, Tatanka would return the favor, bestowing on Chief Jay the highest honor in WWE: Induction into the Hall of Fame.Different Superstars are remembered for different reasons; some because of championship success or classic matches, others because of longevity or innovative in-ring style. Strongbow exhibits all four of those qualities, as well as one other memorable trait: Going on the warpath. The indelible image of his war dance and the resulting knee lifts and chops that his opponents received is among the most iconic in sports-entertainment. Chief Jay Strongbow was a great champion, a charismatic showman and a warrior, and his imprint on sports-entertainment will be felt forever.');

Audaciously interrupting The Rock, the confident new competitor immediately announced himself as a Superstar who wasn’t afraid to make a statement.Son of former NHL standout Ted Irvine, Jericho was born in Manhasset, N.Y., but raised in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.

Even by the anti-establishment standards of the Attitude Era, Chyna upended the status quo from day one: Whereas some female competitors of the time may have been seen as more flash than substance, Chyna came to WWE to fight, serving as the intimidating bodyguard to both Triple H and Shawn Michaels as an original member of D-Generation X. She continued in the capacity of enforcer when the legendary group’s ranks swelled, but individual success was quick to follow.“Success,” however, is probably too soft a word to describe Chyna’s accomplishments or impact. Boldly treading into territories previously reserved for the Y chromosome contingent of the WWE locker room, Chyna broke as many gender barriers as she did bodies. She was the first woman to qualify for the King of the Ring Tournament and the Royal Rumble Match, accomplishing the latter feat in both 1999 and 2000. She was also the first woman to hold the Intercontinental Championship, which she also achieved on two separate occasions.Ironically, it wasn’t until the tail end of her WWE career that Chyna targeted the Women’s Championship. Like all her other goals, she achieved it in dominant fashion, dismantling Ivory at WrestleMania X-Seven to seize the title, which she held until her departure from WWE nine months later.While Chyna’s time in WWE was somewhat brief, the milestones she accumulated would echo long after her departure from the squared circle and her influence on sports-entertainment never faded. Not only did contemporaries like Lita and Trish Stratus continue the trailblazing work she began, but Chyna also paved the way for future Women’s division powerhouses like Beth Phoenix and Nia Jax.During her tenure in WWE, Chyna spoke on several occasions of her desire to be a Queen of the Ring.

Yet, he waxed way more philosophical than his exterior might have suggested, and showed a diverse set of interests that included ghost hunting, G.I. Joe and the “Straight Edge” movement, a subculture that rejects the use of drugs, alcohol and a dependency lifestyle.His in-ring repertoire was an assimilation of fighting styles, all of which were put on full display during his debut on WWE\'s relaunched ECW in 2006. Punk then added many accomplishments to his considerable résumé, including the ECW, WWE, World Heavyweight, World Tag Team and Intercontinental Championships.Punk would become one of the most celebrated WWE Superstars of all time — and did so in spite of the events of 2011, when he assailed Mr. McMahon with his blunt opinions about the business and made a bold promise not to renew his contract with the company.

Punk not only beat John Cena to win that match, but he also absconded with the WWE Championship as the seconds on his WWE contract ticked down.Punk agreed to re-sign with WWE weeks later, compelled to return to the ring by a more lucrative contract and to prove that he was the undisputed “Best in the World.” The Voice of the Voiceless advocated on behalf of disenchanted WWE fans who felt the WWE product was in need of a good (roundhouse) kick in the teeth. He became two-time WWE Champion, proving his mettle by defeating the likes of Chris Jericho, Alberto Del Rio, Daniel Bryan and other elite Superstars.As Punk’s WWE Title reign continued to climb, so did his contempt for those who failed to show him the proper level of “respect.” Proclaiming himself a “Paul Heyman Guy,” Punk aligned with the evil genius of the original ECW and one of his early mentors as his WWE Title reign grew to become the longest of the modern era. Following that historic accomplishment, The Straight Edge Superstar continued to challenge even the most lofty of competitors, challenging The Undertaker’s legendary Streak at WrestleMania 29, engaging in a hellacious war with Brock Lesnar at that year’s SummerSlam and battling and somehow defeating all three members of The Shield in a single match on Raw.Punk\'s final WWE match was On January 26, 2014, Punk was the first entrant in the annual Royal Rumble Match.

Instantly, the relatives were at odds with one another over who was the tougher “super heavyweight.” The former Bob Holly had become known as perhaps the most hardened member of the WWE roster since ditching his “Spark Plug” persona, something Crash was determined to disprove. The younger cousin claimed to be well more than 400 pounds and began carrying a large medical scale to the ring to drive home the point.The inflated sense of self might have been comical, but it brought Crash nothing but success. Despite their clear differences, the two cousins banded together and became a surprising force to be reckoned with in WWE’s busy tag team division. The egomaniacs defeated popular tandems including The Hardy Boyz, Too Cool and The APA. But the Hollys’ biggest success came in October 1999 when they defeated The Rock ‘n’ Sock Connection to win the World Tag Team Championships.Once he achieved his first taste of championship gold, Crash followed in his older cousin’s footsteps and joined the burgeoning Hardcore division. Bob Holly had been a perennial contender for the Hardcore Championship, but he likely never imagined the brand of chaos that would be introduced to the fractured title after bringing his smaller relative to WWE.After Crash won the title for the first time, he declared it would be defended anytime, anywhere, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. From that point forward for the next two years, spontaneous competition in unorthodox locations became the norm, which usually resulted in Crash escaping with his beloved title. Defending the championship in hotel rooms, airport baggage claims, circus parking lots and ball pits earned Crash the nickname “The Houdini of Hardcore.” He won the title on 22 occasions, a number bested only by Raven.The manic nature likely exhausted Crash who made brief sojourns out of the Hardcore division to achieve success elsewhere.

The three defended the World Tag Team Championships under sports-entertainment’s “Freebird Rule,” but were defeated for the titles by The Hart Foundation due to interference from The Legion of Doom. This sparked a series of tag team dream matches against Hawk & Animal, but Demolition soon disbanded.Crush returned in 1992 as a long-haired blond with bright neon tights, fitting for the days of Trapper Keepers and slap bracelets. Embracing his Polynesian roots, Crush became one of the most popular Superstars in WWE. But battling Crush in the ring was no luau. Opponents often fell to his devastating “Kona Crush” maneuver. At WrestleMania IX, Crush battled the evil clown Doink. During the bout, the big Hawaiian was attacked with Doink’s dangerous prosthetic arm and was assaulted by the clown’s clone, who appeared from beneath the ring. For many young fans, it was a terrifying ordeal.After several Banzai Drops from Yokozuna put Crush out of action, he returned a changed man. No longer wearing the colorful neon tights, Crush attacked former friend Randy Savage and accused “Macho Man” of not supporting him through his recuperation. Crush began wearing dark colors and painting his face, and aligned himself with the very man who was responsible for his injury, Yokozuna. At WrestleMania X in Madison Square Garden, Crush faced off with Savage in a brutal Falls Count Anywhere Match. It was the beginning of a downward spiral for the big man, whose personal demons eventually landed him in prison.Out of the big house, Crush re-emerged in 1997 nearly unrecognizable. His hair in long braids and wearing the garb of a dangerous street rough, Crush adopted the horrifying Heart Punch as his signature maneuver and formed The Nation of Domination with Faarooq and Savio Vega. When that group split, he began running with a group of biker thugs called The Disciples of Apocalypse. D.O.A. was a WWE staple during the early part of The Attitude Era.With WWE in a state of transition, Crush moved on and joined his peers as a member of The nWo.

In the ring, they removed their black monster movie masks to reveal painted faces that intimidated opponents before the match even started.Once the bell rang, Demolition made an immediate impact in the tag team ranks, using brute force to pound their opposition into submission.

Quickly, the talented talker built a larger stable known as The Diamond Mine, which included The Diamond Dolls and The Diamond Studd (Scott Hall). That same year, at the unthinkable age of 35, Page began to compete in the ring, experiencing little success at first.In 1994, Page left managing behind completely and began wrestling full time. With a newfound focus, the New Jersey-native started to chalk up victories thanks to his Diamond Cutter finishing maneuver and won the WCW Television Championship from Renegade at Fall Brawl in 1995. Page\'s talent and popularity continued to grow, hitting its peak in 1997 when he stood up to the despised New World Order, a villainous faction led by \"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan, Scott Hall and Kevin Nash that was looking to take down WCW. Now one of the most beloved figures in WCW, DDP battled the NWO week in and week out to big ratings and packed houses.By 1998, WCW\'s Monday Nitro was among the most-watched shows on cable and Page was one of its biggest stars. This newfound celebrity gave DDP the opportunity to compete in some unique, high-profile matches, including teaming with NBA legend Karl Malone and talk show host Jay Leno on separate occasions. Page\'s success in WCW included winning the the World Television Championship, 2 United States Championships, 3 World Heavyweight Championships and 4 World Tag Team Championships.Page continued to be a major player in WCW up until the company was purchased by Mr. McMahon in 2001. That same year, DDP debuted in WWE and attempted to make an immediate impact by setting his sights on The Undertaker. While his determination can be appreciated, the former WCW Champion\'s plan to take out The Deadman did not go well as he was defeated by The Demon from Death Valley on multiple occasions.The following year, Page changed his tune and adopted the persona of a motivational speaker. With the catchphrase, \'That\'s not a bad thing, that\'s a good thing,\' DDP\'s irritatingly positive attitude drew the ire of the WWE Universe. It also drew him some success as he defeated Christian for the European Championship in 2002. Later that year, DDP retired from full-time competition.This wouldn\'t be the last that the WWE Universe saw of DPP. On July 2, 2012, Page made an appearance on Raw, where he hit a Diamond Cutter on Heath Slater. He also appeared at Raw 1000, accompanied by other WWE Legends, during Slater\'s match with Lita.On January 6, 2014, Page again appeared on Raw, along with a number of other legends, as part of the show\'s \"Old School\" theme. On April 5, 2014, an emotional Page inducted his wrestling mentor, Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts into the WWE Hall of Fame.As a result of using yoga to rehabilitate what he thought was a career-ending 1998 back injury in WCW, Page started developing DDP YOGA in 2005. On February 21, 2014, Page appeared on the ABC television series Shark Tank where he declined to sell a 5% share in DDP YOGA for $200,000. He had hoped to use the money to develop a mobile app. The investors believed the company\'s 2013 profits of $800,000 would decline in future years. Page later said he sold more than $1 million worth of product in the first six days after his appearance and used the revenues to build the DDP YOGA Performance Center in Smyrna, Georgia and develop the DDP NOW mobile app.Always one to keep people guessing, Diamond Dallas Page made a surprise return in the 2015 Royal Rumble Match to the delight of the WWE Universe. DDP proved he could still compete with a \"BANG!\" by executing a number of Diamond Cutters before being eliminated. One year later, at WrestleMania 32, the master of the Diamond Cutter showed up to take part in another over-the-top-rope melee: the Andre The Giant Memorial Battle Royal. In 2017, DDP is capping off an incredible career by receving sports-entertainment\'s ultimate honor - induction into the WWE Hall of Fame.');

Das Wunderkind – a German techno dancer – was not a fan of the outdated 1970s dancing style. Alas, Disco Inferno won the WCW Television Title after defeating Wright on the Sept. 22, 1997, edition of Nitro.After losing the title, Disco set aside his differences with Wright to form a comedic tag team known as The Dancing Fools. Often accompanied by Tokyo Magnum, the group delighted — and sometimes annoyed — audiences, but didn’t find a great deal of success and eventually returned to singles competition.Disco Inferno went on to become an unexpected ally of the nWo Wolfpac. Although he was never a full-fledged member of the group that included Sting and Lex Luger, he did become a member of the nWo “Elite” when both nWo Hollywood and the nWo Wolfpac reunited in January 1999. The New World Order soon disbanded and Disco Inferno danced his way into contention for the WCW Cruiserweight Championship. Despite exceeding the title’s strict weight limit, he defeated Psicosis in October 1999 to capture the championship.Following the “reboot” of WCW by Vince Russo and Eric Bischoff, Disco Inferno joined the likes of Rey Mysterio and Billy Kidman in a group called The Filthy Animals. Renaming himself Disqo in a nod to “Thong Song” rapper Sisqo, he unsuccessfully challenged Lieutenant Loco for the Cruiserweight Championship. At Fall Brawl 2000, Disco Inferno turned on The Filthy Animals before reuniting with Alex Wright in a tag team now called The Boogie Knights.When WWE purchased WCW in 2001, Disco Inferno did not join the rival organization and competed on the independent scene before retiring from active competition.

Red-faced that a rival would steal the spotlight from him, Mr. McMahon challenged Trump to a “Battle of the Billionaires” at WrestleMania 23 with the stipulation that the loser of the bout would have their his head shaved bald.A record number of viewers tuned in to watch The Donald back Bobby Lashley to victory over Mr. McMahon’s Umaga and subsequently shave the WWE Chairman’s signature mane in the center of the ring.The business magnates locked horns again in June 2009 when Trump purchased Monday Night Raw and immediately announced that next week’s show would air commercial-free and that every WWE fan that who purchased a ticket would be given a full refund. The trademark Trump public relations flourish nearly made Mr. McMahon’s head explode and forced him to buy his show back from The Donald for twice the price.Following this on-screen rivalry with WWE\'s Chairman, Trump focused beyond his ever-expanding real estate empire and Emmy-nominated reality television show “The Apprentice,” embracing the world of American politics.After trading in his favorite television catchphrase “You’re fired!” for a national promise to “Make America Great Again,” Donald Trump won his first presidential campaign against key contender Hillary Clinton and officially took the oath of office on Jan. 20, 2017, to become the 45th President of the United States — the first time in history a WWE Hall of Famer would ever hold the distinguished title of U.S. Commander-in-Chief.');

Learning his craft with the help of major stars like The Million Dollar Man and \"Hacksaw\" Jim Duggan, Dr. Death quickly developed a reputation as a rough and tumble young competitor.His considerable talents would continue to flourish throughout the 1980s with a successful stint in the National Wrestling Alliance, where Williams claimed tag team gold with Kevin Sullivan and Mike Rotundo on separate occasions.

The two men defeated The Steiner Brothers for the WCW Tag Team Championship during their successful run before returning to Asia less than a year later.Even with his considerable talents and stellar reputation, Dr. Death was never a major star with WWE. He did, however, compete on Raw for a brief period during 1998. During this time, he was managed by his old friend and fellow Oklahoman Jim Ross. Williams also competed in WCW during the tail end of the Monday Night wars, battling Vampiro on several occasions.The big man continued to compete all over the world until 2004 when he announced he had throat cancer and was undergoing surgery.

The behemoth used his mass to crush Hogan\'s ribs during an edition of The Brother Love Show and nearly defeated The Hulkster in their bout at SummerSlam in 1990.The following year, Earthquake would stun the WWE Universe when he attacked Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts. In one of the most shocking moments in WWE history, the big man repeatedly jumped on the bag containing Jake\'s beloved snake, Damien. Earthquake would go on to actually cook and eat the python, proving how vicious he could be.Later that year, the giant teamed up with Typhoon to form The Natural Disasters. One of the largest duos in wrestling history, the massive men battled great teams like The Legion of Doom and Money, Inc. and captured the World Tag Team Championships in 1992. Around this time, Earthquake had a surprising change of heart and became one of the WWE Universe\'s favorite Superstars.Following his split with Typhoon, the Canadian would battle other big men like Bam Bam Bigelow, Adam Bomb and Yokozuna. Earthquake even faced the massive Japanese Superstar in a rare Sumo Match on Raw, which he won.Soon after, the former World Tag Team Champion parted ways with WWE and made the move to WCW. Here, he competed under the name Avalanche and, later, The Shark and engaged in rivalries with Sting, Hulk Hogan and Big Bubba Rogers.Earthquake made his last WWE appearance in 2001 in the memorable Gimmick Battle Royal at WrestleMania X-Seven where he was reunited with his old friend, Typhoon. Sadly, Earthquake passed away in 2006 at the age of 42 after a lengthy battle with bladder cancer.');

To those in the sports-entertainment know, however, Graham\'s legacy is revered as a world-class in-ring performer, promoter and trainer.Trained by Cowboy Luttrell, Eddie Graham began his sports-entertainment career in 1947. Just 17 years old at the time, Graham was billed as Rip Rogers, \"brother\" of the legendary \"Nature Boy\" Buddy Rogers. Competing in Texas over the next decade, he racked up numerous regional NWA Championships -- including a reign as Texas Tag Team Champions with Johnny Valentine -- before being defeated in a Loser Leaves Town Match to Pepper Gomez in 1958.Upon leaving Texas, Graham reverted to his more famous ring name and headed east, where he joined up with brothers Dr. Jerry and \"Crazy\" Luke Graham, and became one of the most reviled Superstars of the 1960s. While Luke stayed solo, Jerry & Eddie were a successful tag team, winning numerous titles up and down the east coast. Their reign of terror included four stints as United States Tag Team Champions in Vincent J. McMahon\'s Capitol Wrestling promotion, and their rivalries with the likes of Miguel Perez and the Bastien Brothers were some of the fiercest the east coast had ever seen.In 1960, Eddie Graham moved on to Florida, the territory he would call home for the remainder of his career. Graham enjoyed much success in Florida over the next 15 years, where he became a local legend. Inside the squared circle, he won numerous championships, including reigns as NWA Florida Tag Team Champions with legendary partners such as Bob Orton Sr., Jose Lothario and his own son, Mike. Graham\'s lengthy rivalry with Boris Malenko was the biggest in Florida throughout the 1960s.In 1968, however, an accident nearly ended his career. A locker room window fell on Graham, and he needed surgery on both eyes and over 300 stitches to rectify the wounds. While unable to compete for more than a year, Graham moved into a different avenue -- that of promoter. He took over as promoter of Championship Wrestling from Florida in 1971, yet still continued to compete in Florida, Georgia and the southeast until 1977. Throughout the 1970s, CWF was one of the industry\'s hottest territories, and home to such greats as Dusty Rhodes, Dory Funk Jr., The Brisco Brothers and legendary announcer Gordon Solie, among others.His success got Graham elected as NWA President in 1976, but health issues forced him to vacate that seat just two years later. As NWA president, he helped promote the first ever NWA vs. WWE Championship unification match in 1978, pitting NWA Champion Harley Race against the fourth brother of the Graham family -- WWE Champion \"Superstar\" Billy Graham. That same year, Graham was named Sports Citizen of the Year in the Tampa area, just one of many community accolades the philanthropic promoter received over the years.Sadly, Graham passed away on Jan. 20, 1985. His passing was heavily mourned, as the 55-year-old promoter\'s death left a void in both the sports-entertainment and civic communities. His beloved CWF territory would officially fold just a few years later.In 2008, one of Graham\'s most successful former employees gave him the ultimate honor, as 2007 Hall of Famer Dusty Rhodes inducted him into the WWE Hall of Fame.');

The big question is what tricks he had in store for his opponent next. Lying, cheating, stealing – it was all fair play in the ring for the unpredictable WWE Hall of Famer.Beyond his mind games though, Eddie was a performer of remarkable versatility. He could make you hate him, then love him, then wonder where the heck you stand – and that\'s all in one night. Regardless of whether the context was serious or lighthearted, Guerrero commanded attention from every spectator.Eddie discovered his unbridled passion for sports-entertainment as a child through his father, longtime wrestling promoter Gory Guerrero. As Gory plied his trade in El Paso, Texas, Eddie was busy scrapping with his nephew Chavo Guerrero Jr. during the show intermissions. Eddie would later move on to wrestle collegiately at New Mexico Highlands University before returning to El Paso to learn how to become a future WWE Superstar.After making an impact in the \'90s for promotions in Mexico and Japan, Guerrero made the jump to ECW, where he quickly became a rising star by winning the ECW World Television Championship in his debut. It was only a matter of time before WCW came knocking and Eddie got a chance to dazzle larger crowds with both his technical prowess and aerial maneuvers.With a new decade came greater ambition and a magnetic new persona for Guerrero as a performer in WWE. Oozing charisma from every pore, Eddie wasn\'t just Eddie anymore, he was \"Latino Heat\" – and WWE competitors soon learned this was a man who was willing to get the edge by any means necessary. All wins were equal in Latino Heat\'s book, even if it meant fooling a distracted referee into thinking his opponent whacked him with a chair.Armed with a gut-busting Frog Splash, Eddie captured five different types of WWE titles, including the WWE Championship when he stunned the mammoth Brock Lesnar in a classic match at No Way Out 2004. Every Superstar from Rey Mysterio to John Bradshaw Layfield knew how taxing a rivalry with Eddie could become, especially when he had something to prove.Even though his career was cut tragically short, Guerrero left an indelible mark on the sports-entertainment landscape as a whole. His battle cry was \"Viva La Raza,\" but the WWE Universe to this day shouts \"Viva Eddie Guerrero\" in remembrance of a legend.');

There was even a legion of groupies – Edgeheads – who tracked his every move.It\'s no surprise, then, that Edge is a guitar collector and grew up listening to KISS, a band famous for their flamboyant outfits and outrageous stage antics. What is a surprise is how a shy high schooler from the little town of Orangeville, Ontario, evolved into The Rated-R Superstar.Even though he was voted \"Most Likely to Be WWE Champion\" by his classmates, Edge\'s path to the grand stage was anything but predetermined. The only spotlights beaming down were at the local factories where he worked odd jobs to help his single-parent mother pay the bills.

Of course, tag teaming wasn\'t Edge\'s only specialty, as he masterfully crafted a singles career and captured a whopping 31 total titles – many of them the WWE Universe didn\'t even see coming.Beyond his ability to capitalize on opportunities, Edge became known as The Master Manipulator because he wasn\'t afraid to cross the line in order to rattle the competition. After he made history in 2006 as the first man to ever cash in the Money in the Bank briefcase, he rubbed his WWE Championship triumph in the face of all challengers with an R-rated celebration on Raw; more explicitly, a frolicking good time with Lita on a bed placed right in the middle of the squared circle.

Over seven AFL seasons with the Chargers, Houston Oilers and Kansas City Chiefs, Ladd became a four-time AFL All-Star and appeared in three AFL Championship Games, winning titles in 1963 (Chargers) and 1967 (Chiefs). Although being one of the largest players of his era, Ladd had amazing quickness for a man his size, earning the nickname \"Big Cat\" as a result.As dominant as he was on the gridiron, Ladd found his second calling while still playing for the Chargers. As a publicity stunt, some San Diego-area wrestlers challenged the Big Cat to a private workout session in the ring, and that\'s where he found his second passion.Ladd soon began competing in the Los Angeles promotion part-time during the football off-season. Due to his reputation as a pro football player, Ladd quickly became one of sports-entertainment\'s hottest draws, and was eagerly sought after by promoters across the nation. As if his mainstream name wasn\'t enough, Ladd also caught mat fans\' attention by becoming one of the sport\'s most despised villains, often stirring up crowds with his cocky and colorful interviews and through the use of his infamous taped thumb.The Big Cat first made his way to WWE in 1968, and the company would become his home base for the next decade. Managed by the Grand Wizard, he was a persistent challenger to WWE Champions Bruno Sammartino, Pedro Morales and Bob Backlund, although he never won the title. His rivalries with fellow behemoths Andre the Giant, Haystacks Calhoun and especially Gorilla Monsoon are also legendary in their own right. After leaving WWE in 1980, Ladd spent the final few years of his career in the Mid-South region, where he once managed fellow Hall of Famers Afa & Sika, The Wild Samoans. When he finally retired in 1986, Ladd had amassed numerous championships all over the United States and Puerto Rico to go with his two AFL Championships.Long a supporter of the Republican Party, Ladd transitioned into politics following his retirement. A friend of the Bush family since the 1960s, Ladd campaigned for both Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, with the junior Bush making Ladd a special deputy to his Presidential Inaugural Committee. In addition to his political activity, Ladd was part of a Christian ministry that provided services to prison inmates, and even owned his own restaurant -- Big Cat Ernie Ladd\'s Throwdown BBQ -- in New Orleans until the effects of Hurricane Katrina devastated the \"Big Easy\" in 2005.Having already been inducted into the San Diego Chargers Hall of Fame in 1981, Ladd added one more accolade to his resume when he was called to the WWE Hall of Fame in 1995. Ladd was inducted by long-time colleague Bobo Brazil, whom the Big Cat had himself inducted one year earlier.Unfortunately, Ladd was diagnosed with cancer in 2004. On March 10, 2007, the Big Cat lost his three-year battle with the disease, passing away in his native Louisiana at the age of 68.

In 1956, she outlasted 12 other ladies -- last eliminating Judy Grable -- to win a Battle Royal for the vacant Women\'s Championship of the World. She would go on to hold the title for the next 28 years, a feat unprecedented in the annals of human achievement. During that time, she became the first woman to ever wrestle in Madison Square Garden, as she and WWE promoter Vincent J. McMahon successfully beat the ban against women\'s wrestling at The Garden.In July 1984, her 28-year reign was finally ended in Madison Square Garden by Wendi Richter, a young competitor managed by pop star Cyndi Lauper. The bout aired live on MTV, giving a whole new generation of sports-entertainment fans a glimpse of the greatest lady competitor in the game\'s history. Following the loss, Moolah began phasing out her in-ring exploits, choosing instead to manage protégé Leilani Kai, one of the many future Superstars she had trained during her time as champion. With Moolah\'s guidance, Kai beat Richter for the Women\'s Title, setting up a match between the two at the first WrestleMania in 1985. Richter would regain the gold, and it would be Moolah herself, under a mask as the \"Spider Lady,\" who would finally take back the championship from Wendi not long after. During her final reign as champion, Moolah also took on another role; she became the \"Queen\" of WWE, often accompanying \"King\" Harley Race and manager Bobby Heenan to ringside.Finally, in July 1987, Moolah lost the gold to \"Sensational\" Sherri Martel, and after captaining a team that defeated Martel\'s in the inaugural Survivor Series later that year, Moolah effectively retired from in-ring competition. As 1987 came to a close, it seemed that the queen of women\'s wrestling had finally come to the end of her run.In 1995, her career was punctuated when she became the first female inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. Inducted by then-Women\'s Champion Alundra Blayze, Moolah was recognized as the true pioneer -- and biggest legend -- in the history of women\'s wrestling.After a 40-year career and induction into the Hall of Fame, imagine the surprise of our fans everywhere when in 1999, Moolah -- by that time in her 70s -- returned to WWE television, this time with long-time friend and fellow competitor Mae Young by her side. That October, the unthinkable happened: Moolah defeated reigning WWE Women\'s Champion Ivory to win the title for the fourth time and become the oldest titleholder in the history of the sport. She didn\'t hold the title gold for long, but it was a testament to her amazing tenacity and ability that she was able to make such a miraculous comeback in the first place.Over the next few years, Moolah -- usually with Mae at her side -- would make a variety of appearances in WWE. In 2003, Moolah celebrated her 80th birthday by facing Victoria on Raw; that night, she defeated Victoria to become the first octogenarian to compete in a WWE ring. Her final appearance came at SummerSlam 2007, where Moolah & Mae were spotted with Mr. McMahon in his office during the show. Less than three months later, on November 2, 2007, Moolah passed away at the age of 84.The name of The Fabulous Moolah will forever be etched in the annals of sport as the defining one in women\'s wrestling. Her name will always be synonymous with success, as she was a true trail blazer that set the path for the Divas of today to show the world what they can do.');

That ignited a brutal rivalry that saw them scuffle in arenas throughout the country and even in a vicious Parking Lot Brawl that is remembered to this day.Finlay found his first piece of championship gold in 1998, defeating Booker T to capture the WCW Television Title. From there, he wreaked havoc in WCW’s hardcore division, relentlessly clubbing his opponents with assorted weaponry on his way to victory. Finlay even won the only match ever to take place in a junkyard.After WCW closed its doors in 2001, Finlay joined WWE as a trainer. By 2005, Finlay had tired of teaching the likes of John Cena and Randy Orton to fight and decided that he had lots of fight left himself. This time, Finlay didn’t need any weapons. All he came armed with were his fists. Finlay joined the SmackDown roster and immediately put every Superstar on notice as he brutalized his opposition to the point where officials had no choice but to disqualify him time and time again.When he was able to control his Irish temper, Finlay was a formidable competitor, capturing the United States Title. With his trusty shillelagh within reach, and his son Hornswoggle hiding under the ring ready to scurry in and distract his opposition, Finlay had the luck of the Irish on his side, as well. Whether he was backing up King Booker or navigating WWE\'s reluanched ECW, Finlay was ready to scrap with anyone and everyone.Though Finlay left active competition in 2010 to return to a role behind the scenes, there’s always a chance that the surly Superstar will get the itch to put up his dukes and start brawling with any and all comers.');

And she knew it, too.One look at Francine and it was clear she was no ordinary Catholic girl from Philly. As devious as she was stunning, the vixen became an immediate sensation upon her arrival in ECW. First identifying herself as an avid Stevie Richards devotee, she became the eccentric grappler’s sweetheart and quickly earned the ire of Raven and Beulah McGillicutty, with whom Francine would often tangle on the canvas – much to the delight of the ECW Arena faithful.After being betrayed by Stevie, Francine took a cue out of Catwoman’s playbook and donned an all-leather outfit to match her new charges, The Pitbulls. Gary Wolfe and Anthony Durante were the bite to their beautiful ally’s bark. In fall 1995, she led The Pitbulls to the ECW Tag Team Championship, and early the next year at CyberSlam, teamed up with them to defeat Stevie Richards and The Eliminators in a Dog Collar Match, pinning her former beau in the process. That summer, she led Durante to defeat Shane Douglas for the ECW Television Title, but Francine was one shrew that couldn’t be tamed.Though the victim of verbal barbs from Douglas for months, Francine turned her back on The Pitbulls at Heatwave 1996 to side with The Franchise himself. The seductive Francine assisted ECW’s despised quarterback en route to two reigns as ECW World Champion. She became an integral cog in his Triple Threat group, often playing a key role at ringside for the matches of members Chris Candido and Bam Bam Bigelow.When Douglas departed ECW, Francine aligned herself with the organization’s heart and soul: Tommy Dreamer.

But when Tommy finally became ECW Champion, Francine executed yet another double-cross, this time essentially handing the title to the unlikely Justin Credible.Under Francine’s guidance, Credible became ECW’s bona fide top villain. And when the smug jerk lost the title, he knew to take seriously the devilish backstabber’s threats to leave him – unless he regained the gold.

Although Gotch was unsuccessful against the champion, it took McLeod nearly two hours to defeat the rookie.After touring the Yukon and earning the nickname “Champion of The Klondike”, Gotch returned to the United States and defeated Tom Jenkins to become American Heavyweight Champion. Not satisfied with being America’s best, Gotch set his sights on George Hackenschmidt and the Heavyweight Championship of the World.In 1908 at Dexter Park Pavilion in Chicago, “The Russian Lion” Hackenschmidt was unable to continue in the second fall of their championship match and surrendered the World Heavyweight Championship after being punished for over two hours by Gotch.Gotch met Hackenschmidt again on September 4, 1911 at the brand new Comiskey Park in Chicago, drawing almost 30,000 fans to witness a historic battle that generated over $87,000 in ticket sales, the equivalent of well over two million dollars today. Gotch won the rematch in under 30 minutes by targeting “The Russian Lion’s” injured right knee and giving him the option of being pinning or having his foot broken. Hackenschmidt chose to be pinned.The 5-foot-11, 210-pound native of Humboldt, Iowa was one of America’s most popular professional athletes from 1900 until his retirement. Gotch became such a celebrity that he was in demand for public appearances everywhere. Once, while attending a Chicago Cubs baseball game at Wrigley Field, nearly every member of the Cubs team came to his private box and asked for his autograph. He starred in a play called \"All About A Bout” that toured internationally. The World Heavyweight Champion was even invited to the White House by President Teddy Roosevelt.Gotch reigned as World Heavyweight Champion from his first victory over Hackenscmidt in 1908 until he retired in 1913.

Whether as a wrestler, a manager or a fashion plate, Blassie\'s legacy all comes down to having one important trait: He could make anyone hate him in an instant. And boy, did people ever.The unpopular Superstars of today may be subjected to loud boos, some name calling and the occasional mocking sign in the crowd, but none of them may ever experience the repercussions that Blassie did thanks to his villainy. While one would think that frequent death threats, 21 stab wounds and an acid dousing by irate fans would encourage an individual to change vocations, for Blassie the experiences did not deter him from his passion -- competing in the ring and gaining incredible attention for doing so.Blassie developed his toughness from growing up in a working-class neighborhood in south St. Louis. While he was pushed toward all sorts of different careers, it was sports-entertainment for which Blassie developed a passion; from the age of 17 on, Blassie was almost always in the ring.He officially began his career in 1935, working his way up from the preliminary ranks in Missouri. Blassie joined the Navy during World War II, which interrupted his career only briefly; upon his discharge from the military in 1946, he returned to his chosen profession, one he would leave his mark on for the next 40 years.Throughout the 1950s, Blassie dominated the southeastern United States, racking up numerous regional championships. Although he never claimed a World Championship, he gave some of the greatest World Champions of all time -- including Lou Thesz and Pat O\'Connor -- a run for their money.Moving out west in the 1960s, Blassie continued his dominance. He was so hated in California at the time that he frequently needed full security from uniformed police officers just to get to the arenas. In that decade, however, Blassie once again racked up numerous regional titles on the West Coast, and if he wasn\'t hated enough already, he became truly reviled after a particularly brutal attack on Japanese Superstar Rikidozan in 1962. Allegedly, the sight of one of their national heroes covered in his own blood caused many Japanese fans to suffer heart attacks.Upon returning to the United States, Blassie made his way to WWE. He had previously spent a short time in WWE in the mid-1960s -- challenging Bruno Sammartino for the WWE Championship on numerous occasions -- but it became his permanent home in 1970. Managed by Captain Lou Albano, Blassie once again challenged for the WWE Championship, but was unable to unseat Pedro Morales for the gold.In 1974, Blassie ended his in-ring career and became one of the most successful managers of his time. It was at this point in his career that he became known as the \"Hollywood Fashion Plate,\" renowned for going to ringside dressed in the loudest of outfits and using his equally loud voice to mock others as \"pencil-necked geeks.\"Over the next decade, Blassie managed numerous Legends and future Hall of Famers, including High Chief Peter Maivia, Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura, Mr. Fuji and George \"The Animal\" Steele. He also managed Muhammad Ali during his 1976 bout against Antonio Inoki, and even guided the career of Hulk Hogan for a short time during Hulk\'s first WWE tenure in the late-1970s and early 1980s.Perhaps his most successful run as a manager, however, came while helming the careers of Nikolai Volkoff & Iron Sheik. Touting himself as \"Ayatollah\" Blassie, the \"Classy\" one led Sheik to the WWE Championship in 1983 -- a title he would quickly lose to former Blassie protégé Hulk Hogan only weeks later. In 1985, Blassie led Volkoff & Sheik to the World Tag Team Championship, as they defeated Barry Windham & Mike Rotundo on the first WrestleMania card.During his managerial career, Blassie\'s charisma carried him into several outside ventures as well. In 1975, he lent vocals to a pair of songs recorded by Johnny Legend -- including one aptly titled \"Pencil Neck Geek\" -- and in 1982 he was the subject of Andy Kaufman\'s documentary film My Breakfast with Blassie.In 1986, however, Blassie\'s career came to an official end. After bringing Slick to WWE -- and selling half interest in his stable of wrestlers to the \"Doctor of Style\" -- Blassie finally gave full control to his protégé and retired after over 50 years of entertaining.Despite failing health in his later years, Blassie would occasionally appear on WWE programming. This time, however, our fans softened their previously harsh stance on the \"Fashion Plate,\" rabidly cheering the Legend when he would appear. In 1994, he was recognized for his half-century of greatness by being inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by Shane McMahon. Two years later, he received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 1996 Slammy Awards.Sadly, \"Classy\" Freddie Blassie\'s final WWE appearance came in May 2003, when he appeared on Raw to promote his autobiography, \"Listen, You Pencil Neck Geeks\" -- which became an instant best seller. On June 2, Blassie passed away due to heart and kidney failure at the age of 85.While he may be gone, \"Classy\" Freddie Blassie will never be forgotten. He was one of the most despised Superstars the world has ever seen, but in his wake he left behind a legacy of greatness that may never be equaled, and he will forever be known as a true Legend of sports-entertainment.');

In 1984, Mean Gene came to WWE as a locker room interviewer and announcer.

From a young age, he spent most of his time in the pursuit of physical fitness, excelling in cycling, gymnastics, swimming, running and jumping.After graduating from school, he began a career as a blacksmith\'s apprentice, but never lost his love of fitness. He joined the city\'s Athletic and Cycling Club and became an award winning cyclist, but, more importantly, developed an interest in both wrestling and weightlifting. George was a prodigy on the mat and in the weight room. His dedication to perfection would result in history, as he invented weightlifting’s hack squat, wrestling’s bear hug and went on to win the European Greco Roman amateur wrestling championship in Vienna in 1898. That same year, he also captured the Russian weightlifting championship.Hackenschmidt began wrestling professionally in 1900 and entered a 40-day wrestling tournament in Moscow, eventually taking home the championships of both Moscow and St. Petersburg. He continued to win tournaments, including several to determine a world champion. By 1901, there was no denying “The Russian Lion,” who was recognized as wrestling’s first World Heavyweight Champion.Hackenschmidt competed throughout Europe, Australia and even at New York City’s Madison Square Garden, remaining undefeated until 1908, when he lost to Frank Gotch in Chicago. Three years later, their rematch at the newly constructed Comiskey Park drew approximately 30,000 fans and generated $87,000 in ticket sales, the equivalent of well over two million dollars today. An injured right knee is cited as the main reason that Hackenschmidt was unable to win back the title and return it to Europe. The knee injury forced him into to retirement that same year, but Hackenschmidt’s days as a celebrity were far from over.Adored by women and admired by men, Hackenschmidt was revered as a hero.

However, with his trademark green tongue, hairy torso and penchant for eating turnbuckles, George \"The Animal\" Steele might be the most unorthodox man to step foot in a WWE ring.While he was always seen as a savage during his WWE tenure, Steele is actually a very well-educated man. Prior to breaking into sports-entertainment, Steele received his Masters Degree from Central Michigan University and became a high school teacher and wrestling coach in the Detroit area.It was during his teaching stint that he began moonlighting in sports-entertainment, working in the Detroit-area promotions. His first WWE appearances took place in 1967, when he came to WWE and began a heated rivalry with champion Bruno Sammartino.Both inside the ring and out, Steele lived up to his moniker; like a true animal, he was virtually impossible to contain. At times, his various managers were able to control him, but for the most part, Steele did whatever he pleased. He clawed at opponents, bit them, and used just about every illegal maneuver ever concocted. His most devastating hold, however, was his vaunted Flying Hammerlock, which could separate an opponent\'s shoulder in mere seconds. The looks of pain on his foes\' faces when he applied the hold remain among the most indelible impressions in the mat game\'s history.In a sport where speaking skills sometimes overshadow athletic ability, it\'s a testament to Steele that he had such an impact without talking. This is not to say that he didn\'t use his mouth, of course. When he wasn\'t biting his opponents, he could often be seen eating turnbuckles, much to the amusement of the fans. His opponents would then be summarily tossed headfirst into the exposed steel bolt that secured the ropes to the ring post.For nearly 20 years, Steele was a hated rule-breaker, managed by the likes of fellow Hall of Famers The Grand Wizard, \"Classy\" Freddie Blassie, Capt. Lou Albano and Mr. Fuji. While he never captured a championship, his classic rivalries with Bruno Sammartino, Gorilla Monsoon, Pedro Morales and Bob Backlund saw him come close on numerous occasions.In 1985, however, Steele became a fan-favorite and changed the course of his career. After The Iron Sheik & Nikolai Volkoff abandoned him during a match, Steele fell back under the tutelage of the then-beloved Albano. His transformation was remarkable, as one of the most hated men in the sport became one of its most beloved figures.Just when many thought Steele\'s career might be winding down, he once again rose to prominence. He developed a crush on Miss Elizabeth and feuded with her charge \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage, nearly capturing the Intercontinental Championship in 1986. While he was unable to win the gold, he would cost Savage the title in 1987; during Savage\'s famous bout with Ricky \"The Dragon\" Steamboat at WrestleMania III, Steele shoved Savage off the ropes, preventing him from driving the ring bell into the challenger\'s throat. Moments later, Steamboat pinned Savage to end the \"Macho Man\'s\" reign.Shortly thereafter, Steele gained a new \"friend\" named Mine, a stuffed animal with a hairy torso and bald head just like \"The Animal.\" Unfortunately, Steele and Mine faded away soon after. Nearly a decade later, however, \"The Animal\" had one last run in WWE when he came out of retirement to be a part of the Oddities -- a fitting return if ever there was one.In 1995, Steele received the ultimate honor when he was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by Doink the Clown. His induction featured a cameo video appearance by actor Bill Murray, with whom Steele appeared in the 1994 film Ed Wood (Steele played Tor Johnson). Also in 1995, Steele was inducted into the Michigan High School Coaches Hall of Fame based on his accomplishments prior to his sports-entertainment days.Since Steele left WWE, his legend has only grown. He remains one of the most recognizable men outside sports-entertainment, and his very name still evokes terror on one hand and sympathy on the other.

From Johnny & Jimmy Valiant to Terry & Dory Funk and beyond, many duos have shown that blood truly is thicker than water. In the southeastern United States, however, there is one sibling connection that stands above the rest -- Jack & Gerald Brisco.Nine years the junior of brother Jack, Gerald Brisco followed his sibling into the world of sports-entertainment in the late-1960s. Like Jack, Gerald was an amateur standout, winning many AAU tournaments and earning a scholarship to Oklahoma State University. Following his collegiate career, Gerald trained under his older brother, adopting his signature Figure-Four Leglock, and made his official debut in 1968.Throughout the 1970s, The Brisco Brothers were a dominant force in the southeastern United States, especially in Championship Wrestling from Florida. Together, the duo racked up nearly two dozen reigns as tag team champions, including three as the NWA World Tag Team Champions in 1983 and 1984.During that time, Gerald also patterned his brother\'s solo success. While never a World Champion like Jack, Gerald also held the Southern Heavyweight and Florida Heavyweight Championships, as well as several other regional NWA titles. In 1981, he reached perhaps the pinnacle of his solo success by winning the NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship, a title previously held by such greats as Danny Hodge, Dory Funk, Sr. and Hiro Matsuda.In the late 1970s, Jack & Gerald Brisco discovered a young talent in Florida that they referred to Matsuda as a potential trainee. In 1984, that man won the WWE Championship and became synonymous with WWE as it began its expansion into a global phenomenon. That man, of course, is none other than Hulk Hogan.Also in 1984, however, the Briscos made their own impact in terms of helping WWE\'s national expansion. That summer, he and Jack -- who had held a controlling interest in the Georgia Championship Wrestling territory in the early 1980s -- sold their majority stake in the company and its Saturday timeslot on WTBS to WWE Chairman Vincent K. McMahon, giving WWE its first national platform and effectively putting GCW out of business. While McMahon sold everything to Jim Crockett less than a year later, it was one of the first steps in turning WWE into the global phenomenon it is today.Gerald Brisco retired soon after that and began working in the WWE front office. As a close confidant of the WWE Chairman, Brisco found his way back to television in the late-1990s. He and fellow associate Pat Patterson -- dubbed \"The Stooges\" by some -- stood faithfully at McMahon\'s side as he battled the liked of \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin and his own children. Brisco also stepped into the ring from time to time, even winning the Hardcore Championship twice in 2000 -- which eventually led to the infamous Hardcore Evening Gown Match between Brisco and Patterson at King of the Ring 2000.The Brisco Brothers also used their record of tag team excellence in the world outside the ring. Along with another brother, Bill, the Briscos have owned and operated The Brisco Brothers Body Shop in the Tampa, Fla., area for more than 30 years. The Brisco Brothers Body Shop has become an iconic establishment on the Sun Coast, much like its owners were inside the squared circle.In 2008, The Brisco Brothers were recognized for their achievements in sports-entertainment with induction into the WWE Hall of Fame. While there may be an overwhelming rivalry between Texas and Oklahoma, Lone Star native JBL put that aside for one night to induct two Okies he has become very close with. On his own, Gerald Brisco is one of the most decorated Superstars in sports-entertainment history, and a bona fide legend in Florida and the southeastern Untied States.

Billed as El Gigante (Spanish for “The Giant”), the young competitor received an enormous amount of support from WCW executives who believed they discovered the second coming of Andre the Giant. The plodding big man wasn’t exactly “The Eighth Wonder of the World,” but his alliance with Sting and his battles against hated villains like Sid Vicious and Ric Flair made him a popular attraction with WCW fans.In 1993, the Argentinean competitor joined WWE where he made an unforgettable debut in that year’s Royal Rumble Match. Although not officially a participant in the over-the-top-rope brawl, the giant made a startling appearance in the middle of the bout, lurching to the ring in a bizarre fur body suit that made him look like a shaved Wookie. Strange appearances aside, the 8-foot brute immediately targeted The Undertaker and savaged The Deadman in a way few Superstars have ever done.Now known as Giant Gonzales, the tallest Superstar in WWE history challenged The Demon from the Death Valley at WrestleMania IX and nearly stopped The Undertaker’s legendary “Streak” before it even started. Although he failed to defeat The Deadman, Gonzales went on to make mincemeat out of a series of overmatched opponents, oftentimes handling three Superstars at once.With pipsqueak manager Harvey Wippleman guiding his career, the wild giant continued to battle The Undertaker in arenas across the country for months before the two titans faced off for the final time at SummerSlam 1993. Billed as a Rest in Peace Match, the no rules brawl saw Gonzales push The Deadman to his limit before Undertaker finally defeated one of his most imposing rivals with a flying clothesline from the top rope.Giant Gonzales left WWE soon after SummerSlam 1993 and competed in New Japan Pro Wrestling before retiring to a farm in Argentina. The real life giant struggled with complications stemming from his immense size for the remainder of his life before passing away in September 2010. Although he died too young at age 44, Gonzales made his mark as an unforgettable sports-entertainment attraction.');

The hero was, indeed, bald, and he wore black tights. And he had the same mannerisms and growl of a certain former WCW World Champion. But his neck was … let\'s just say less-than-massive and had more of a \"pencil-neck geek\" aura. The biceps — if you could call them that — didn\'t really cause Hulk Hogan sleepless nights. As the smoke cleared — and our hero choked on the fumes — it became painfully (yet amusingly) apparent that sometimes imitation, depending on whom you talk to, can be the finest form of flattery.And that\'s how Duane Gill, better known as Gillberg, will be remembered by WWE fans and the object of his impression, Goldberg. Gillberg was WWE\'s playful poke at Goldberg during the height of the Monday Night War with WCW. Arguably, Gillberg personified the ruthlessness and aggression of the Attitude Era as much as \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin — no one was exempt from parody and the gloves were decidedly off in the battle for Monday night supremacy.Before his breakthrough as Gillberg, Gill was most familiar to our fans as a shaggy-haired performer with limited abilities and skill who bravely entered the ring with any and all comers. Gill rarely had success, but he kept getting up and coming back for more. As Gillberg, he had more notoriety and even managed to snag championship gold, shocking Christian and the world when he won the Light Heavyweight Championship in November 1998. Though his win-loss record was more Brooklyn Brawler than Goldberg, Gillberg holds a record in the WWE history books — he\'s the longest-reigning WWE Light Heavyweight Champion ever!Gillberg returned to WWE briefly in 2003, actually just long enough to get man handled by WWE\'s newest signee, Goldberg.

What was inside this prehistoric-sized egg was a complete mystery to everyone in the WWE Universe, but speculation still ran rampant. Was it a famous World Champion waiting to make his WWE debut? Could it be the first grappling dinosaur in sports-entertainment history?All these questions were answered at Survivor Series on Nov. 22 when the egg finally cracked. With the trustworthy \"Mean\" Gene Okerlund standing by, the shell broken open and one of the most disappointing personas in WWE history made its first appearance. Known as The Gobbledy Gooker, this 6-foot turkey was greeted by a chorus of boos from the disappointed crowd of 16,000 fans in the Hartford Civic Center. Instead of a returning Superstar or a beautiful woman, the fans got a walking Thanksgiving dinner.Ironically making its WWE debut on the very same night as the legendary Undertaker, the birdbrain proceeded to gobble incoherently at a visibly underwhelmed Okerlund before shaking its tail feather in an embarrassing dance routine that lasted an endless five minutes. The only thing that could be heard over The Gooker\'s pratfalls was the sound of the entire WWE Universe retreating to the concession stands.Although The Gobbledy Gooker\'s debut was an unmitigated disaster, the turkey continued to make sporadic appearances on WWE television for the next several months. The bird eventually flew the coop, but made a surprising return at 2001\'s WrestleMania X-Seven in the memorable Gimmick Battle Royal. Like an Ed Wood movie, The Gooker was such a terrible persona that it eventually endeared itself to the WWE Universe and the big bird received a rousing ovation at the event.Since then, the feathered fellow has made a few scattered appearances in WWE, but the person under the mask has always been a surprise. At Survivor Series in 2008, the terrifying Boogeyman dressed up in the bird costume in order to scare Carlito & Primo.

Armed with two signature maneuvers — The Spear and The Jackhammer — Goldberg displayed a devastating mix of raw power and unbridled intensity that made him unstoppable.With fans chanting his name in arena across the country, “Da Man” ascended to the top of WCW in record time, defeating the iconic Hulk Hogan for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship in front of more than 60,000 fans in the Georgia Dome within a year of his debut. Eventually, Goldberg’s undefeated streak run came to an end at the hands of Kevin Nash — and a stun gun wielded by Scott Hall— but the competitor was not deterred for long. Throughout the remainder of his WCW career, he dominated a laundry list of hard hitters, including Bam Bam Bigelow, Sid Vicious and Scott Steiner.After WCW was purchased by WWE in 2001, WWE fans eagerly awaited the arrival of the powerhouse, but it would be two long years before Goldberg entered a WWE ring. On March 31, 2003, the wrecking machine finally made his WWE debut, spearing The Rock on Raw. This confrontation led to a showdown between the two icons at Backlash with Goldberg buzz sawing through The Great One.In the following months, the brute continued to dominate the competition, spearing Chris Jericho, Mark Henry and many others on a warpath to the top of WWE. To get there, however, Goldberg had to get through Triple H, which was no easy feat. The big man found this out at SummerSlam in the Elimination Chamber when The Game defeated him following a vicious sledgehammer shot.Goldberg finally defeated The Cerebral Assassin for the World Heavyweight Championship one month later at Unforgiven before deciding to leave the ring for good.

Names like Walter Cronkite and Howard Cosell are world-renowned in the fields of news and sports, and their unmistakable voices could sooth a dire situation yet also magnify a great one.   In sports-entertainment, there are many great commentators, but few whose voices are synonymous with excellence. Of those, there is only one \"Dean,\" one man who has been called both the \"Walter Cronkite\" and \"Howard Cosell\" of the industry; that man is the legendary Gordon Solie.Hailing originally from the state of Minnesota -- home to hundreds of sports-entertainment legends -- Solie moved to Tampa, Fla., in the 1950s after completing military service in the United States Air Force. Little did he -- or anyone, for that matter -- know that while starting out as a radio disc jockey and promotions man, Solie would eventually become one of the most famous voices of all-time.Solie began his sports-entertainment career as a ring announcer, making $5 a night emceeing weekly shows in the Tampa Bay area. He soon began working for Championship Wrestling from Florida, and in 1960, he moved into the broadcast booth to become the lead announcer for CWF\'s Saturday morning television shows, a spot he would occupy for the next quarter-century. During that time, he commentated on matches featuring some of sports-entertainment\'s biggest legends, including WWE Hall of Famer Dusty Rhodes, the Brisco Brothers and Dory Funk, Jr., among numerous others.Solie rose to national prominence when Superstation WTBS began broadcasting sports-entertainment, and the exposure helped him branch out, leading to Solie working for promotions in Georgia, Alabama and Puerto Rico. What our fans in those areas found out was something Floridians had known for years: That Solie was a true icon.Much of his fame stems from his gravelly-yet soothing voice he used to call the in-ring action and his unique lingo. He is credited for originating the term \"Pier-Six Brawl\" to describe a wild brawl, and was also notorious for noting when a bloodied Superstar was \"wearing the crimson mask.\" His vast knowledge of the impact of each maneuver shone in his words, including his oft-imitated signature call of a suplex as a \"su-play.\"Solie often said that his approach to calling matches was low-key -- yet he could convey the increased importance of a moment simply by slightly modifying his tone of voice. His signature sign-off -- \"So long from the Sunshine State,\" followed by a wink -- became an institution among Florida wrestling fans of multiple generations.When CWF finally folded in 1987, Solie returned to Georgia and became one of the lead announcers for the NWA (later WCW) television programs. It was a natural transition for \"The Dean,\" who had also been Georgia Championship Wrestling\'s lead announcer before it became a subsidiary of NWA/WCW. He remained there until his eventual retirement in 1995.Sadly, Solie was diagnosed with cancer soon after his retirement. In the late-1990s, his vocal chords were removed due to throat cancer, robbing the world of one of the greatest voices to fill the airwaves. In July 2000, Solie finally succumbed to cancer at the age of 71, leaving behind five children and a multitude of fans.In 2005, his posthumously-released memoir Gordon Solie ... Something Left Behind became a best-seller, proving that his legacy and his memory will never be forgotten by the generations of sports-entertainment fans fortunate enough to have grown up -- or grown old -- with the sound of his voice. In 2008, \"The Dean\" took his rightful place in the pantheon of the elite as Jim Ross inducted him into the WWE Hall of Fame, an honor accepted by Solie\'s five children - Pam, Danise, Jonard, Eric and Greg. ');

The industry was never the same.\nBorn in 1915, George Wagner grew up poor in Nebraska during the Great Depression and turned to professional wrestling as a way to earn a living. Early in his career, Wagner was a normal, clean-cut grappler like most of the competitors of the era. Due to his small stature and limited abilities in the ring, he experienced little success. Then he got an idea.\nSeeing an opportunity to bring more entertainment to the world of professional wrestling, George Wagner became Gorgeous George, a snooty, platinum blonde villain who draped himself in lace and fur and entered the ring to the strains of \"Pomp and Circumstance.\" Accompanied by a manservant who sprayed the ring down with Chanel perfume, George would enrage the audience just by walking into an arena. When the official would attempt to check George for foreign objects, he would recoil and shout, \"Get your filthy hands off of me!\"\nWhile this behavior may seem tame by today\'s standards, it was unheard of in the 1940s. Needless to say, audiences ate it up and bought tickets just to hate him. At the same time, televisions were becoming a fixture of American households during the post-World War II economic boom and professional wrestling was what everyone was watching. With his over-the-top antics and self-proclaimed nicknames like \"The Beautiful Bicep\" and \"The Sensation of the Nation,\" Gorgeous George quickly became the biggest attraction on this new medium. By the end of the decade, the man who grew up poor was now the highest paid athlete in the world.\nGeorge would remain a major star throughout the 1950s, often competing in highly publicized matches where his precious golden locks were on the line. In 1963, George passed away at the age of 48, but his amazing influence would live on through legends like Buddy Rogers, \"Superstar\" Billy Graham, Ric Flair and countless others. Any Superstar who has used an entrance theme, donned a robe or given themselves a nickname owes a debt of gratitude to George Wagner.\n20th century luminaries like Muhammad Ali, Bob Dylan and James Brown have also noted George as a major influence on their personas. \"Gorgeous George: The Outrageous Bad-Boy Wrestler Who Created American Pop Culture,\" a 2008 biography on the legend by John Capouya, went as far as to claim that George created pop culture as we know it today.\nIt is this unrivaled impact that earned Gorgeous George a place in WWE\'s Hall of Fame.');

While the generation of WWE fans growing up in the 1980s and 1990s may only remember Monsoon as a broadcaster, an earlier generation remembers him as one of the most feared competitors in sports-entertainment.As a youth, Robert Marella was a standout athlete, lettering in three sports in high school. He continued on to Ithaca College, where he became one of the most accomplished wrestlers in the school\'s history; so accomplished, in fact, that he was inducted into his alma mater\'s Athletic Hall of Fame in 1979.Following his college graduation in 1959, Marella began wrestling in New York as Gino Marella; shortly after, however, he re-debuted for northeast promoters Vincent J. McMahon and Joseph \"Toots\" Mondt as Gorilla Monsoon, a \"former Asiatic Champion\" billed as hailing from Manchuria. With manager \"Wild\" Red Berry at his side to do all the talking, Monsoon was instantly one of the most hated Superstars in the country. He used his immense size to his advantage and looked the part of a savage, decimating his opponents with his Manchurian Splash and famed Airplane Spin.When WWE broke away from the NWA in 1963, Monsoon became one of the cornerstones of the new promotion. In November of that year, Monsoon teamed with fellow Hall of Famer Killer Kowalski to win the United States Tag Team Championship, at title he would hold once again a few years later with \"Cowboy\" Bill Watts.Later that same month, however, he stepped into the ring with then-WWE Champion Bruno Sammartino at the old Madison Square Garden in a match that both men would later cite as the toughest of their careers. It went the full 90-minute time limit without a winner decided, and became just the first in a long series of battles between Monsoon and Sammartino over the gold.In 1969, Gorilla Monsoon was mercilessly attacked on television by The Sheik, a wrestler even more vicious and hated than he. Former arch-rival Sammartino came to his rescue; the two then became friends, leading to Monsoon becoming a huge fan favorite, which he would remain for the rest of his career. The 1970s saw Monsoon go through a complete reversal, as one of the most despised men of the previous decade became one of the most beloved of the next.The most high-profile incident of his wrestling career occurred in 1976 during a match with Baron Mikel Scicluna in Philadelphia. Boxing\'s Heavyweight Champion, Muhammad Ali, rushed the ring at the end of the match, dancing and throwing jabs at Monsoon. Gorilla responded by hoisting the champ into an airplane spin and slamming him to the canvas.A year later, boxing would again come into Monsoon\'s spotlight, as he met Andre the Giant in a boxing match in Puerto Rico, which was won by Andre. By that time, however, Monsoon\'s career began to wind down, and in 1980, he lost a Retirement Match to Ken Patera. Gorilla only wrestled a handful of times after that (in special Legends matches), but that was just the beginning of the second phase of his career.Monsoon had been a partial owner of WWE since its inception; in 1982, he was bought out by Vincent K. McMahon, who was in the process of purchasing WWE from his father. McMahon put Monsoon behind the mic, sparking his legendary broadcasting career by making him the WWE\'s top play-by-play man. Gorilla worked with many partners on many different television shows, and became the voice of pay-per-view when WWE expanded into the new genre in the late 1980s. As a commentator, Monsoon gave birth to a slew of \"Gorilla-isms,\" various phrases that he used repeatedly during his commentary. During this time as well, Monsoon\'s son Joey Marella began working as a WWE referee, a duty he would continue until his untimely passing in 1994.Monsoon and Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura (his first pay-per-view partner) are considered by many to have been the greatest commentary team in the history of sports-entertainment. Monsoon also formed a winning duo with good friend Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan, playing the exasperated straight man to great effect and coining him as \"The Weasel.\" Their run as hosts of Prime Time Wrestling on the USA Network has produced some legendary comedy, and in a fitting end, it was Monsoon who threw \"The Brain\" out of the Manhattan Center during his final appearance on Raw in 1993.While still active in 1994, Monsoon was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by fellow announcer Jim Ross. That wasn\'t the end of his career by any means, however; while Ross succeeded him as the lead voice of WWE, Monsoon took on another role in 1995 when he became WWE President. He was a key figure on WWE television while in this role, but as his health began to deteriorate, he began to appear less and less until relinquishing his post in 1997.After stepping down as president, Monsoon spent the majority of his time backstage as a coordinator; in fact, the producers\' area just behind the curtain is known as \"Gorilla\" in his honor. His last public appearance came at WrestleMania XV in Philadelphia on March 28, 1999, where he acted as a judge for the Brawl for All Match. Sadly, on Oct. 4 of that year, Robert Marella passed away at the age of 62.For 40 years, he entertained audiences and dedicated himself to the business like few others. Whether in the ring, at the mic or behind the scenes, Robert \"Gorilla Monsoon\" Marella will always be remembered as one of the greatest of all-time; he stands out as a true giant, both in size and reputation.');

For more than two decades, \"Hacksaw\" defended America\'s honor in the ring and enjoyed distinction as one of the most recognizable Superstars in the world.Duggan\'s immense popularity did not come overnight, though. An exceptional athlete, \"Hacksaw\" was drafted by the Atlanta Falcons, but was later cut due to knee injuries. With his football career over, Duggan turned his attention to sports-entertainment. Starting out in the late \'70s, the powerful grappler competed across the country under the name \"Big\" Jim Duggan. The tough guy clearly had strength and charisma, but there was little to distinguish him from the hundreds of other brawlers ruling the rings at the time.It wasn\'t until the New York native joined Mid-South Wrestling in 1982 that he began to develop the personality traits that fans love him for today. After battling Butch Reed for the rights to the nickname \"Hacksaw,\" Duggan began carrying a 2x4 to the ring. The big man\'s block of wood became an iconic part of his persona, but its beginnings were practical. With fans being extremely overzealous and often dangerous at the time, Duggan\'s mentor, Bruiser Brody, suggested he lug a weapon to the ring to protect himself. \"Hacksaw\" grabbed a 2x4 and the rest is history.The 2x4 would be firmly in Duggan\'s grasp when he joined WWE in 1987. Wasting no time in displaying his patriotism, \"Hacksaw\" immediately locked up with the massive Russian known as Nikolai Volkoff and had many hard-hitting matches with the dangerous Soviet. The following year, \"Hacksaw\" had one of the biggest victories of his career when he won the inaugural Royal Rumble by eliminating One Man Gang. The victory was proof that Duggan was the real deal.In the years that followed, the patriot continued to cultivate a massive fan following through his heroic battles against hated villains like Dino Bravo, Bad News Brown and Boris Zhukov. Duggan even defeated Haku in 1989 to win the right to call himself the \"King of Wrestling.\" The shiny crown may have looked out of place atop \"Hacksaw\'s\" smiling mug, but he wore the prize with great pride.Throughout the early \'90s, Duggan\'s reputation as a fan favorite carried on, but he eventually suffered a series of disappointing losses to the likes of Yokozuna and Bam Bam Bigelow. The losing streak led \"Hacksaw\" to make a surprising change when he joined World Championship Wrestling in 1994. The move proved to be a good one for him, though, as he defeated \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin to win the United States Championship on his first night in the company. Duggan would battle the likes of Big Bubba Rogers and Diamond Dallas Page over the next four years before something changed his life forever.In 1998, \"Hacksaw\" was diagnosed with kidney cancer. The disease was an intimidating opponent for a man who had locked up with the likes of Andre the Giant, but Duggan refused to go down without a fight. Thanks to early detection and \"Hacksaw\'s\" unbreakable spirit, he beat cancer and amazingly returned to the ring with little time off.After finishing out his contract with WCW, Duggan made his long-awaited return to WWE in 2005.

Managed by the incomparable Bobby “The Brain” Heenan, The Islanders were a fearsome duo that had a hard-hitting rivalry with The British Bulldogs.Following an injury to King Harley Race, the Tonga-native claimed Race’s throne and returned to singles competition under the moniker “King Haku.” Upon Race’s return, Haku solidified his monarchy by defeating the WWE Hall of Famer. Although he lost the throne to “Hacksaw” Jim Duggan, Haku’s alliance with Andre the Giant — known as The Colossal Connection — earned them the WWE Tag Team Championships from Demolition. However, a memorable rematch at WrestleMania VI marked the end of the dominant pairing as Haku accidentally struck his partner, ultimately costing them the match. After a short-lived tag team with The Barbarian, Haku left WWE and moved to Atlanta and Ted Turner’s WCW.The former WWE Tag Team Champion joined WCW as Meng — a mysterious and powerful bodyguard for Col. Rob Parker. But his reputation preceded him and underneath the sunglasses and suit was the monstrous Tongan brawler ready to be unleashed. Ditching the sport coat, Haku was embroiled in bitter rivalries with WCW’s top competitors including Sting and Road Warrior Hawk. Eventually reuniting with The Barbarian as The Faces of Fear, the duo joined The Dungeon of Doom and The Alliance to End Hulkamania.During the late 1990s, Haku enjoyed a winning streak that earned him an opportunity against undefeated WCW Champion Goldberg. Although Haku lost the bout, he continued to maintain his status as a tough competitor, eventually winning the WCW Hardcore Championship. Relinquishing the title, Haku returned to WWE one week later during the 2001 Royal Rumble Match. After a short tenure, the WWE locker room breathed a collective sigh of relief when the monstrous Superstar retired.Haku was one of the most respected and feared competitors in and out of the ring, establishing his incomparable reputation during sports-entertainment’s most revolutionary period in both WWE and WCW.\n ');

But when he removed his conical hat and delicate robes to reveal a body that was covered from head to toe in Japanese script, he made an impression that few WWE fans would forget.Described by Shawn Michaels as the “greatest Japanese wrestler,” Hakushi quickly disposed of a young Matt Hardy in his debut match with a mix of blistering martial arts strikes and spectacular aerial maneuvers.

The moniker was soon abandoned in favor of a name he would retain for the remainder of his WWE tenure: Bob Holly.Holly got his first taste of championship gold in ’95 when he joined forces with The 1-2-3 Kid to win the vacant World Tag Team Championships. The team was short-lived and Holly turned to the shrill loudmouth Jim Cornette, who was gathering a group of old-school competitors to form a National Wrestling Alliance cadre within WWE. Teaming with “Bodacious” Bart Gunn as The New Midnight Express, “Bombastic” Bob scored the NWA Tag Team Championships.When that partnership crumbled, Holly re-emerged with a blond crewcut as one of the early stars in WWE’s burgeoning Hardcore Championship division. Changing his name to Hardcore Holly, the nasty brawler held the title on six occasions and established his on-screen persona as one of the toughest men in WWE — a fact the locker room was already well familiar with. He also exchanged the title with his cousin Crash, with whom Holly defeated The Rock ‘n’ Sock Connection to win the World Tag Team Championships.In 2002, Holly brought his toughness to SmackDown and engaged in his most high-profile rivalry to date. Caught in Brock Lesnar’s massive clutches, The Alabama Slammer refused to simply admit defeat. Lesnar slammed Holly onto the canvas, breaking Hardcore’s neck. Holly was on the shelf for more than a year, and eventually came up short in a match for Lesnar’s WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble 2004, exactly 10 years after his WWE debut.Possessing one of the highest levels of seniority in the organization, Holly was a respected member of the relaunched ECW brand and handed CM Punk his first loss in WWE. After moving to SmackDown, Holly became a mentor to young rookie Cody Rhodes, with whom Holly won his third World Tag Team Championship. The unlikely pair impressively held onto the titles for more than six months, culminating in the pupil turning on his teacher at Night of Champions 2008.

While the third-generation member of that family -- The Rock -- may be the most well-known, it all started with his grandfather, the legendary High Chief Peter Maivia.Maivia, born in Samoa in the 1930s, was a \"blood brother\" of the Anoa\'i family. In the early 1960s, he moved to New Zealand to begin his in-ring career, training under South Pacific legend Steve Rickard. The High Chief quickly took to his profession, winning numerous championships in the South Pacific and Hawaii before finally coming to the United States in 1970.The High Chief dominated the west coast in the 1970s, winning multiple championships in both Los Angeles and San Francisco. At different times, he held versions of the NWA Tag Team Championship with such greats as Pat Patterson, former World Tag Team Champion Billy White Wolf and Ray \"The Crippler\" Stevens. During his time in California, he also formed a close mentor-student relationship with \"Superstar\" Billy Graham.  Maivia also competed in Texas for a short spell, but rose to national prominence when he entered WWE in the late-1970s. He was very popular, and well-known partially because of the tribal tattoos that adorned his body; the ink was indicative of his status as a Samoan High Chief, a tradition that would later be carried on by his grandson, The Rock.During the final years of his career in WWE, Maivia battled former friend Graham for the WWE Championship while also forming a successful tandem with Bob Backlund. When Backlund won the WWE Title from Graham, however, Maivia shocked our fans by turning on his friend and becoming one of the most hated men in the industry. Led by \"Classy\" Freddie Blassie, The High Chief challenged Backlund on numerous occasions, but never walked away with the gold. He also still sporadically competed in Hawaii and California as well, beginning a bitter rivalry with another former protégé, Victor Rivera.Maivia was also active outside the ring. He helped train numerous future Superstars, such as Graham, Wild Samoan Afa and Rocky Johnson -- who later married Maivia\'s daughter, despite the High Chief\'s objections -- and took over the reigns of the NWA\'s Hawaiian operations in 1980. He also played a vile henchman in the 1967 James Bond film You Only Live Twice, perhaps foreshadowing a silver screen legacy that would be carried on by The Rock 35 years later.Sadly, Maivia was diagnosed with cancer in 1981, and tragically passed away in June 1982 at the age of 45. The original ring name of his grandson, Rocky Maivia, was chosen partially in tribute to the High Chief; in 2008, The Rock paid an even greater tribute to his grandfather by inducting him into the WWE Hall of Fame.');

In front of a sold-out Madison Square Garden crowd of nearly 22,000, Koloff ascended to the top turnbuckle and dove onto the WWE Champion, Sammartino. His knee crushed onto Bruno’s throat, and “The Russian Bear” covered the Italian powerhouse to score a stunning three-count. Suddenly, the screaming New Yorkers in attendance fell eerily silent.

He won numerous regional NWA championships in the 1960s and early 1970s, including multiple reigns with the prestigious NWA Missouri Championship, Southern Heavyweight Championship and Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship.On July 20, 1973, Brisco scored the biggest win of his career by defeating Harley Race to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. He held the gold for more than a year before falling to Giant Baba in Japan in December 1974; however, he regained the gold a week later and held it for another year, finally losing it to Terry Funk in December 1975. This match was one of many in a lengthy rivalry between both Brisco brothers and Terry & Dory Funk, a brutal and bitter war that raged on for nearly a decade in several territories.Following his reigns as NWA World Champion, Jack once again began teaming with brother Gerald. The two were once again dominant in Florida and Georgia, racking up multiple tag team championships. Finally, in June 1983, The Briscos won the NWA World Tag Team Championship from Ricky Steamboat & Jay Youngblood. They would hold those titles on three occasions over the next year before Jack\'s retirement.Outside the ring, Jack Brisco had just as big of an impact as he did inside it, helping pave the way for the national expansion of WWE. In the late 1970s, Jack & Gerald discovered a young talent in Florida that they referred to Matsuda as a potential trainee. In 1984, that man won the WWE Championship and became synonymous with WWE as it began its expansion into a global phenomenon. That man, of course, is none other than Hulk Hogan.Also in 1984, he and Gerald -- who had held a controlling interest in the Georgia Championship Wrestling territory in the early 1980s -- sold their majority stake in the company and its Saturday timeslot on WTBS to WWE Chairman Vincent K. McMahon, giving WWE its first national platform and effectively putting GCW out of business. While McMahon sold everything to Jim Crockett less than a year later, it was the first step in turning WWE into the global phenomenon it is today.The Brisco Brothers also used their record of tag team excellence in the world outside the ring. Along with another brother, Bill, The Briscos have owned and operated The Brisco Brothers Body Shop in the Tampa, Fla., area for more than 30 years. The Brisco Brothers Body Shop has become an iconic establishment on the Sun Coast, much like its owners were inside the squared circle.In 2008, The Brisco Brothers were recognized for their achievements in sports-entertainment with induction into the WWE Hall of Fame. While there may be an overwhelming rivalry between Texas and Oklahoma, Lone Star native JBL put that aside for one night to induct two Okies he has become very close with.On his own, Jack Brisco is one of the most decorated Superstars in sports-entertainment history, and a bona fide legend in Florida and the southeastern Untied States. Paired together, however, The Brisco Brothers are icons of sports-entertainment in another stratosphere altogether.');

He grew up enamored with sports-entertainment greats Danny Hodge and \"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams, both of whom would personally help the Superstar on his career path. First becoming involved in competition at age 5 and attending a high school that boasted several state wrestling championships, he quickly developed into an outstanding amateur grappler, becoming a two-time high school heavyweight state champion. In true American fashion, he earned a full scholarship to a Division I school in both wrestling and football.Swagger\'s tremendous amateur background carried him into the world of WWE, in a manner reminiscent of such legends as Bob Backlund and WWE Hall of Famers Jack and Gerald Brisco. His defined technique brought a completely different competitive style to WWE, and the WWE Universe took notice of his impressive combination of strength, ability and squared circle acumen, all complementing his physique and charisma.It wasn’t long before Swagger etched his name into the annals of WWE lore, winning a Money in the Bank contract, the World Heavyweight Championship and the United States Championship in the name of his native country.

Those that expected the unimposing female to be the demure type were in for a shock when she teamed up with the devious Taskmaster, Kevin Sullivan. The pairing was perfect as Sullivan tossed his hapless foes to the arena floor where Jacqueline scooped them up and viciously slammed them down.Despite the displays of her wrestling know-how, Jacqueline was still targeted by a few of WCW’s male competitors who thought picking on her was a no-lose situation. The beauty was more than happy to prove the likes of Disco Inferno wrong with a hard punch to the jaw and her DDT.Jacqueline jumped to WWE in summer 1998, joining forces with Marc Mero in his quest to steal the spotlight back from his former valet, Sable. Jacqueline proved to be a tall task for the blond bombshell. She defeated Sable to win the returning WWE Women’s Title. Adding insult to injury, she later chopped off her foe’s platinum tresses and wore it in her hair, flaunting her spoils.Jacqueline would go on to hold the Women’s Title on another occasion, defeating Harvey Wippleman (not a typo) on SmackDown in 2000. Even while remaining a full-time competitor, Jacqueline took on other jobs in WWE. She donned the stripes and became an official, calling the shots in both men’s and women’s matches.  In addition, she took an active role as a trainer on the first season of “Tough Enough,” helping potential Superstars and Divas learn the ropes.Eventually, Jacqueline decided to put all her focus towards her in-ring career and regaining the Women’s Title. While she didn’t capture that championship, she did find surprising success in another division. Answering an open challenge from Chavo Guerrero, Jacqueline brushed off the third-generation Superstar’s put-downs and defeated him to win the WWE Cruiserweight Title. Although she left WWE in June 2004 after losing the title back to Chavo, Jacqueline’s impact on the Divas division would be felt for years.

Eager to follow in his father’s footsteps, Roberts began competing in the early ’70s, making a name for himself in promotions throughout the South. In 1983, he tasted success for the first time, winning the NWA World Television Championship while wrestling with Georgia Championship Wrestling.Roberts then took his talent, and his patented DDT finisher to the pinnacle of entertainment, WWE, arriving at the promotion in 1986. Right out of the gate, the Snake sought to make a name for himself, targeting fan favorite Ricky “The Dragon” Steamboat. He made his intentions known when he savagely DDT’d Steamboat onto a concrete floor, putting him in the hospital for weeks.As if that wasn’t enough to curry hatred from the WWE Universe, Roberts stirred the pot further each week, hosting his show, The Snake Pit.

Four years later, he returned to WWE  and faced Stone Cold at the 1996 King of the Ring. Roberts came up short in the bout, but had a role in the creation of WWE history, when Stone Cold mocked Roberts’s perpetual quoting of the Bible verse “John 3:16,” by barking “Austin 3:16 says ‘I just whooped you’re a$$!’” In that moment, a catchphrase was born and a legend was launched.Following that historic event, Jake’s appearances in WWE have been sporadic but memorable, such as a 2005 appearance on Raw when he confronted a young Randy Orton prior to the Viper’s WrestleMania match against the Undertaker. Later that year he worked with the company to produce the tell-all DVD Pick Your Poison, which offered a no-holds-barred look at his tumultuous career.Whether competing in the ring, or burrowing into the psyches of his opponents, Jake “The Snake” Roberts will go down in the annals of WWE history as one of the most cunning and lethal Superstars ever to step between the ropes.

Though Jeff often was the recipient of beatings that made the WWE Universe cringe, his refusal to give up on his dream of becoming a WWE Champion got him noticed by officials.The Hardy Boyz became full-time WWE competitors in 1998, when their high-flying offense and plaid tights made them stand out in the eyes of the WWE Universe.

He was a successful one, too, with four reigns as WCW World Heavyweight Champion and six as WWE Intercontinental Champion with the bulk of his runs coming during a particularly excellent stretch for that title.The son of Nashville wrestling promoter Jerry Jarrett, Double J began his career as a referee, but soon enjoyed the benefits that the spawns of ring power players have always been handed. But Jarrett — unlike, say, Erik Watts — had a skillset that allowed him to succeed beyond his father’s safety net.Introduced to WWE audiences in 1993 as an obnoxious country singer, Double J draped himself in garish, light up clothing and capped off all his interviews by spelling out his full name and asking, “Ain’t I great?” His shtick could be grating, but his success was undeniable as he wrestled the Intercontinental Title away from Razor Ramon on more than one occasion.Jarrett’s musician act unraveled when it was revealed that The Roadie (who would later gain his own fame as Road Dogg) had performed the vocals on Double J’s “hit” song “With My Baby Tonight.” The humiliation sent Jarrett running to WCW where he would act as both a Four Horseman and a Four Horseman turncoat during a year with the company.Jarrett’s reinvention as a tough, Southern villain during WWE’s “Attitude Era” has largely been forgotten — although a partnership with Owen Hart was as entertaining as it was successful — but he had a run of luck with the persona in WCW.

Fifteen years later, the WWE Hall of Famer recreated this legendary TV moment with Jim Carrey on the set of the Andy Kaufman biopic, “Man on the Moon.”After dispatching of Kaufman, The King ruled over promotions like Minnesota’s AWA and Tennessee’s USWA before finally arriving in WWE in 1992.

With a global audience watching, he led Condrey, Eaton and, later, Stan Lane, to global success. Under his tutelage, The Midnight Express captured the NWA World Tag Team Titles on two occasions and the U.S. Tag Team Titles on three.“The Louisville Slugger” also wanted the biggest spotlight on himself, so he joined WWE in 1993. Camp Cornette quickly came to include Yokozuna, Owen Hart, British Bulldog and the unruly Mastodon, Vader. Cornette and his charges were a consistent thorn in the sides of WWE Champions like Diesel and Shawn Michaels.After becoming an announcer in 1997, he also took up arms against those who undermined the wrestling business. Cornette got on his soapbox in a series of Keith Olbermann-esque monologues on Monday Night Raw, punctuated by an almost-unneeded statement: “I’m Jim Cornette and that’s my opinion.”Though Cornette was out of WWE rings by 1999, he still had a hand in many Superstars’ careers. Cornette helped establish Ohio Valley Wrestling as a WWE developmental territory, bringing future WWE Superstars to his hometown. At OVW, Cornette fostered talent that went on to become multiple-time World Champions, including Batista, Brock Lesnar, Randy Orton and John Cena.Who would have thought that Mama Cornette’s investment in her baby boy would still be felt in the WWE Universe today?');

The two duos competed in amazing matches throughout the mid-80s with both teams capturing the World Tag Team Championship on separate occasions.Eventually, The Hart Foundation parted ways and Neidhart teamed up with another brother-in-law — Owen Hart. Often times during the early \'90s, Anvil and Owen would be at odds with \"Hit Man,\" but the family joined forces again when a new Hart Foundation was formed in 1997. Consisting of Neidhart, Bret, Owen, Davey Boy Smith and Brian Pillman, this faction was wildly pro-Canadian and often stirred crowds into a frenzy with their anti-American rants.After the infamous events of Survivor Series 1997, Neidhart joined \"Hit Man\" when he left WWE for World Championship Wrestling.

His rivalries with Ted DiBiase, The Fabulous Freebirds and Butch Reed -- among others -- were some of Mid-South\'s most legendary, and along the way he amassed numerous reigns as Mid-South North American Champion and Mid-South Tag Team Champion.Late in 1984, JYD came to WWE, and once again, he became an instant hit with the fans. The sight of JYD — clad in his collar and chains, striding to the ring to the strains of his unforgettable entrance theme, \"Grab Them Cakes\" — was one that our fans loved but his opponents dreaded. He was well-known for his finishing maneuver, a powerslam he called \"Thump\" — one so monumental that he wore the word \"Thump\" across the back of his wrestling trunks -- as well as his vicious head butts.Although he never won a championship in WWE, JYD had quite a bit of success while remaining one of the most popular Superstars of the 1980s. Just months after his debut, he faced Greg Valentine for the Intercontinental Championship at the inaugural WrestleMania, defeating \"The Hammer\" by count-out but not winning the gold. No matter, as later that year, JYD won the first-ever Wrestling Classic, a King of the Ring-style tournament that was also WWE\'s first foray into pay-per-view. Two years later, JYD engaged in a rivalry with \"King\" Harley Race over the crown that culminated in a bout at WrestleMania III.Junkyard Dog\'s success continued after leaving WWE, as he moved to the NWA (later WCW) in the late-1980s and briefly warred with Ric Flair over the NWA World Championship. He also held the WCW Six-Man Tag Team Championship in 1991 before retiring from the ring in 1993.Unfortunately, Sylvester Ritter\'s life was tragically cut short on June 2, 1998. While driving home from his daughter LaToya\'s high school graduation in North Carolina, Ritter was involved in a single-car accident on a Mississippi highway that claimed his life. He was only 45 years old.In 2004, Junkyard Dog was posthumously given the biggest bone of all when he was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame alongside 10 of his contemporaries — including WWE rivals Valentine and Race. Fellow Hall of Famer Ernie Ladd — himself one of the biggest African-American Superstars of the 1970s — inducted JYD into the Hall, with daughter LaToya Ritter fittingly accepting the induction on his behalf.Junkyard Dog had a unique combination of power, grace and charisma that is rarely seen in sports-entertainment. Inside the ring, his bite was certainly just as powerful as his bark — a fact that many of his rivals will attest to — and as a member of the Hall of Fame, his legacy will never be forgotten by sports-entertainment fans.  ');

Whether tangling with Great Muta in the rings of Japan or pushing Brian Pillman to the limit in WCW, this one-of-a-kind competitor appeared to be a superhero come to life.If Liger looked like a character sprung from a seizure-inducing Japanese cartoon, it wasn’t an accident. His persona was directly inspired by a popular anime of the same name. This wasn’t an uncommon practice in Japan — both Tiger Mask and Vader were based on animated characters — and it helped endear Liger to a young fanbase.His distinctive horned mask and “Mighty Morphin Powers Rangers” bodysuit may have turned heads, but it was Liger’s fantastic talent in the ring that made him more than just a gimmick. A fearless innovator who had the nerve to create the Shooting Star Press, Liger devastated opponents with a mix of impactful top rope maneuvers and blunt martial arts strikes.First emerging as a star in Japan in the late 1980s, Liger beat noted light heavyweights like Hiroshi Hase, Ultimo Dragon and Shinjiro Otani en route to capturing the coveted IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship a record 11 times. Considered among the top wrestlers in the world in the early ’90s, he made his name stateside in WCW in 1991 during a rivalry with the talented Brian Pillman that introduced breathtaking lightweight action to the promotion long before the institution of the Cruiserweight Title.Liger sporadically appeared in WCW up through the late ’90s — most notably in a successful outing against Rey Mysterio at Starrcade 1996 — while actively competing in Japan, Mexico and smaller American promotions. Constantly changing with the times (Liger’s look was often updated to mirror his animated counterpart and he sometimes revealed an evil alter ego known as Kishin Liger), the aggressive flier has managed to stay relevant across four decades — even returning to the ring in the mid-90s after a brain tumor nearly took his life.Although he replaced many of his top rope maneuvers with a ground attack style later in his career, Liger remains an influential figure for young Superstars, who have built upon his dazzling aerobatics. It’s in this way that the legend of Jushin Liger will carry on.The next chapter in that legend was written on Aug. 22, when Liger made his WWE debut at NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn.

Not much was known about Kamala\'s life before venturing into sports-entertainment, other than that he was a savage from the wild who apparently worked as a bodyguard for former Ugandan leader Idi Amin. He was never seen without Kim Chee, as he spoke no English — conversing only in loud yelps and grunts — and looked like a true jungle beast.Barefoot and clad only in a loin cloth, face paint, and moons and stars painted on his chest, Kamala came to the ring wearing a ritual African tribal mask and carrying a spear, often slapping his ample belly as well. A disturbing enough sight for opponents, made all the worse when you add in the fact that Kamala was 6-foot-7, 350-pounds-plus of savage beast.In 1982, Kamala first came into sports-entertainment when he was brought into Mid-South and World Class Championship Wrestling by the devious General Skandor Akbar.

In 1995, Shamrock became the UFC’s first champion outside of tournament competition, winning the Superfight Championship before competitors were divided by weight class. Establishing a hall of fame career in UFC, The World’s Most Dangerous Man decided to move onto a then grander stage in 1997 by joining WWE.Making his first appearance at ringside in February 1997, Shamrock soon became involved in the heated rivalry between Bret “Hit Man” Hart and “Stone Cold” Steve Austin. At WrestleMania 13, The Excellence of Execution and The Texas Rattlesnake engaged in a No Disqualification Submission Match with Shamrock as the special referee that gave the WWE Universe their first glimpse of The World\'s Most Dangerous Man\'s physical nature.Shamrock soon entered active competition and quickly became one of the most feared Superstars on the WWE roster.

Debuting as a sunglassed ringside enforcer in WWE, Nash quickly made an impact by taking on the role of Shawn Michaels\' personal – and cold-blooded – bodyguard.

After finally losing the championship to Bret Hart at Survivor Series in 1995, Diesel battled foes like The Undertaker before making a move that forever changed the sports-entertainment landscape.In the spring of 1996, Nash and Scott Hall left WWE and invaded World Championship Wrestling. Soon joining forces with Hulk Hogan, they became known as The New World Order, one of the biggest must-see attractions in history. Defiant, arrogant and dangerous, the rebel group completely dominated WCW and soon had fans tuning into Monday Nitro by the millions. Titles such as the WCW Tag Team Championship turned into nWo trophies as The Outsiders of Nash and Hall flattened many smaller opponents.Eventually, though, the massive egos of Nash and Hogan clashed, leading Nash to form an nWo splinter group known as The Wolfpac. Including top dogs such as former World Champions \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage, Lex Luger and Sting, the powerful faction helped propel Nash to the very top of WCW as a singles competitor. At the end of 1998, Nash pulled off the unthinkable by felling the undefeated Goldberg at Starrcade, capturing the WCW World Heavyweight Championship and breaking the titan\'s legendary winning streak. He would acquire the coveted title a total of five times before WCW folded in 2001.The vaunted trio of Nash, Hall and Hogan made their return to WWE at No Way Out in 2002, but the reunion wasn\'t \"just too sweet.\" The nWo cronies butted heads with the likes of \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin and The Rock before the group disbanded and a series of injuries put Nash on the shelf for several months.

However, \"Big Sexy\" failed to rise above The Game and disappeared from WWE again soon after.More than seven years later, the WWE Universe saw Nash step over the ropes again in a stunning comeback.

Sullivan’s explanations were often more incomprehensible than his actions. What’s clear is that he started out in 1970 as a generic grappler in smaller NWA territories. By the early ’80s, he had emerged in Championship Wrestling from Florida as the “Boston Battler,” but Sullivan soon made a dark turn.At a time when heavy metal acts like Ozzy Osbourne and Judas Priest were terrifying suburban parents with their allusions to devil worship and ancient mysticism, Sullivan rose up as pro wrestling’s very own “Prince of Darkness.” Surrounding himself with a group of twisted misfits — including Maha Singh from the streets of Calcutta, the sage-like snake handler known as The Abudadein and Purple Haze, who literally walked out of the ocean — the Beantown brawler became an ominous enemy to Florida heroes like Dusty Rhodes and Blackjack Mulligan.With his face painted black and white and his body armored in leather and steel, Sullivan spoke of the “closet of anxieties” and “cosmic cookies” in his perplexing interviews. In the ring, he was even more disarming as he beat on opponents with utter disdain. He started out matches by recklessly tossing foes to the concrete floor and artlessly ended bouts by jumping feet first onto a victim’s sternum. And that was Sullivan playing nice. An incident involving Blackjack Mulligan and a broken bottle is still spoken about in hushed tones across the panhandle.Sullivan wasn’t always so dramatic. He palled around with collegiate athletes like Mike Rotundo and Steve Williams in a stable of jock bullies dubbed The Varsity Club in WCW in the late ’80s. And alliances with Tazz in ECW and Cactus Jack in WCW were more about anarchy and less about Aleister Crowley. Nevertheless, Sullivan would return to his supernatural roots in mid-’90s WCW in an attempt to bring down Hulk Hogan once and for all.Leading a group of oddball outcasts that included Kamala the Ugandan Giant, The Zodiac and a 7-foot mummy that broke free from a block of ice, Sullivan captained his Dungeon of Doom from a neon-lit cave in some parallel universe.

Soon, however, he was competing all throughout the United States and Canada as well as overseas. Perhaps his most infamous moment came at the Montreal Forum in 1954, and it was the night he truly earned the \"Killer\" nickname. During a Steel Cage Match against Yukon Eric, Kowalski ripped off part of his opponent\'s ear, cementing his already frightening reputation.After winning several regional titles in North America in the first half of his career, Kowalski came to WWE and became a perennial No. 1 contender to Bruno Sammartino during Bruno\'s lengthy title reign. While he was never able to unseat Sammartino (or later Pedro Morales), Kowalski enjoyed tag team success in WWE. He and Gorilla Monsoon held the United States Tag Team Championship in 1963, and more than a decade later, Kowalski and trainee, Big John Studd donned masks and won the World Tag Team Championship in 1976 as The Executioners.As a strict vegetarian devoutly dedicated to fitness, Kowalski was able to outlast many of his peers in the squared circle. However, as he began winding down his in-ring career, Kowalski\'s second career as a trainer became more prominent. Studd was one of his first trainees, and after officially retiring in 1977, Kowalski moved to suburban Boston and opened up a wrestling school.The Killer Kowalski Institute of Professional Wrestling stood for a quarter-century, turning out several future WWE Superstars in the process; 14 time WWE World Heavyweight Champion Triple H, WWE Performance Center Head Trainer Matt Bloom and former ECW and WCW World Tag Team Champion Perry Saturn are just a few of the Superstars who began their career under Kowalski\'s tutelage. In 2003, however, Kowalski sold the rights to his school and stepped out of the spotlight after nearly 60 years in the business.Once Kowalski\'s students graduated, however, they were never far from his heart. In 1994, he made a surprise appearance at ECW to give Saturn and fellow trainee John Kronus new ECW World Tag Team Championships.

His skeleton-like outfit and unusual charisma made him a quick fan favorite, despite his villainous actions in the ring.He caught the eyes of WCW officials when he took part in the groundbreaking “When Worlds Collide” pay-per-view in 1994, which led to him making his debut in the Atlanta-based promotion in 1996. Competing in the Cruiserweight division, La Parka often stood out because he was much taller and stockier than his lightning-fast opposition.La Parka certainly knew how to slow them down, though. Shortly after joining WCW, La Parka discovered the advantages a steel chair presented him. The Mexican star embraced the chair, never keeping it far from his reach. He clutched it close as he made his way to the ring, stopping to bust out an air guitar riff on the weapon before dishing out punishment.It didn’t matter if you were friend or foe, anyone who crossed La Parka’s path ended up tasting cold steel. In fact, at Souled Out 1998, following an Eight-Man Tag Team Match, “The Chairman” clobbered all four of his opponents, then took out his own team before breaking out into a dance routine on the chair.In 1999, WCW got to hear a little something from the normally silent luchador, or so it seemed. La Parka would grab the microphone and stand atop his chair to address the crowd, as a voice that didn’t seem to fit him declared that “Skull Captain’s in the hizzouse!” After informing fans that he had two chair shots ready to go, one for him and one for his homies, La Parka’s “voice” would dish out a few insults toward his challenger. The luchador would toss the microphone away as if it were possessed before begging his opponents not to beat him. The old “that wasn’t my voice” routine didn’t work on guys like Meng and Finlay, so “The Skull Captain” often found himself on the receiving end of a great deal of punishment.After the voiceover incidents, La Parka left WCW, heading back to his native Mexico, where he still competes to this day.

But let\'s be honest -- especially you ECW fans -- wasn\'t Lance Storm\'s pose as a member of the Impact Players better? And only Storm could make a single leg Boston Crab pretty with the roll-through version he called the Canadian Maple Leaf.It\'s not surprising that Storm was so graceful and technically sound in the ring. He was one of many technicians trained in the famous or infamous -- Hart Dungeon. Storm made his debut against another Dungeon alumnus, Chris Jericho, in 1990, and shortly thereafter, the two became partners in a team called Sudden Impact. The team turned heads on the Canadian independent wrestling scene and toured Japan until parting ways in 1992. From there, Storm wrestled all over the world, from Asia to Germany to Lebanon and Austria, making a name for himself while becoming versed in different styles of mat prowess. He briefly reunited with Jericho under a new tag team name (The Thrill Seekers) when he wrestled for the Tennessee-based Smokey Mountain Wrestling. But then he returned to Japan to perform for Wrestling Association \"R\" (WAR).At this point, Storm was a wrestling vagabond. His experience was extensive, but he was still unknown to most U.S. fans. That would change when Storm heard these letters for the first time: E-C-W.Lance Storm first made an impression on U.S. fans, particularly the hardcore wrestling fans in Philadelphia, when he won the ECW Tag Team Championship with Chris Candido from fellow world travellers, Doug Furnas & Phil Lafon. But Storm really made an impact as a member of the Impact Players along with partner (and former protégé) Justin Credible. Accompanied by both Jason and Dawn Marie, the Impact Players were one of the most dominant units in ECW history, winning two ECW Tag Team Championships and waging memorable wars against Tommy Dreamer, Raven, Jerry Lynn, Sandman and Sabu, among others. Incredibly, Storm never held singles gold in ECW. But after entering WCW in 2000, no singles champion was safe.Storm arguably had the most successful run of his career in WCW, winning the United States Championship, the Cruiserweight Championship and WCW\'s version of the Hardcore Championship. At one point, he held those three championships simultaneously and made a run at the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, but WWE Hall of Famer Booker T turned back his challenge. Storm formed a faction, Team Canada, and had a rivalry with Gen. Rection\'s Misfits in Action for several months before WCW folded in 2001.Afterward, Storm brought his expertise to WWE. Storm won the World Tag Team Championship four times with three different partners (Christian, William Regal and Chief Morley, aka Val Venis) and the Intercontinental Championship.Storm retired from a full-time wrestling schedule in 2004 and since then, he has helped train some of WWE\'s greatest Superstars. As a trainer in WWE\'s developmental system in Louisville, Ky., he helped Melina, Johnny Nitro, Mr. Kennedy, Jillian Hall, Bobby Lashley, Mickie James, Dolph Ziggler and Kenny Dykstra, among others.

It was not to be, though, as Mickie James defeated her at Survivor Series, and Cryme Tyme added insult to injury by giving away her personal items to the crowd.It was a bitter end for the Diva, but she will not be forgotten. Despite her controversial nature during her last active years, WWE fans always embrace Lita when she makes a rare appearance – especially the night before WrestleMania 30, when Lita took her rightful place in the WWE Hall of Fame.');

But the daughter of famed Canadian grappler Paul \"Butcher\" Vachon didn\'t just have role models in her own home; they\'re all over her family. Her uncle, Maurice \"Mad Dog\" Vachon, was a five-time AWA World Champion, and aunt Vivian Vachon was one of the most successful female Superstars of the 1970s.As a youngster, Luna would often climb into the ring with her father, aunt or uncle before or after their matches. After making it clear that she wouldn\'t be dissuaded of a career in the ring, Luna officially trained under Vivian and The Fabulous Moolah in the mid-1980s and made her professional debut in 1986. Competing in Championship Wrestling from Florida as a member of Kevin Sullivan\'s clan, she struck fear into her opponents based on her physical presence alone: A half-shaven mane of blond hair, freaky face paint and a sneer that never seemed to leave her face.After leaving Florida, Luna spent time as a competitor and a manager in various independents and Puerto Rico. Finally, in 1993, she came to WWE for the first time, replacing Hall of Famer \"Sensational\" Sherri as Shawn Michaels\' manager. She later moved on to managing Bam Bam Bigelow, eventually falling in love with the \"Beast from the East\" and becoming his \"main squeeze.\" The duo warred with Doink the Clown and his pint-size prankster sidekick, Dink, for months, leading to a match where Bam Bam & Luna defeated Doink & Dink at WrestleMania X.Later in 1994, Luna sold Bam Bam\'s contract to Ted DiBiase and concentrated on winning the revived Women\'s Championship. While she was unable to win the title from then-champion Alundra Blayze before leaving WWE late in 1994, her hand-picked henchwoman -- Japanese Superstar Bull Nakano -- eventually did claim the gold.Short stints in both ECW and WCW followed before Luna returned to WWE in 1997 to stand by the side of The Artist Formerly Known as Goldust. Luna quickly developed a rivalry with Sable, leading to another WrestleMania Mixed Tag Team Match. This time, however, Luna & Goldust were defeated by Sable & Marc Mero. The following year, however, the two Divas would patch up their differences, and for the first time, Luna heard the cheers of our fans.Paired with Sable and The Oddities -- a collection of Superstars who were all slightly bizarre in some way -- Luna became quite popular. It wouldn\'t last, however, as Luna would later attack Sable and rekindle their rivalry. Throughout 1999, she continued to chase the Women\'s Championship and also managed Gangrel before leaving WWE for good in early-2000. Thereafter, she had been semi-retired, occasionally returning to the ring from time to time for various independent promotions.Even though she never captured the Women\'s Championship, Luna was one of the most feared and respected competitors of the 1990s. At a time when the word \"Diva\" was being redefined in WWE, Luna Vachon was one of those who used her talents and unique look to help rewrite the lexicon.');

Even in the rough world of sports-entertainment, where every match could be a Superstar\'s last, a quarter-century is considered an incredibly lengthy career. Take that and triple it, however, and you have the span of one of the greatest female competitors to ever lace up a pair of boots — Mae Young.Johnnie Mae Young began her professional career in 1939. Already an incredible athlete — she was on her Tulsa, Okla.-based high school wrestling team and a national champion softball player — Young embarked on her chosen livelihood at the tender age of 15.Throughout the 1940s, she blazed a path for future female grapplers everywhere; with World War II in its midst, many territories that didn\'t feature women\'s wrestling began to open up those doors, which Young and her contemporaries kicked down.She remained one of the most active and successful female Superstars throughout the next few decades. Young was the first U.S. Women\'s Champion, and her lengthy rivalry with the legendary Mildred Burke was one of the most storied of the time. In fact, in 1954, she and Burke were among the first female competitors to tour post-war Japan.Young\'s legacy was further cemented the day she decided to help train future Superstars. One of her pupils would go on to become arguably the biggest icon in women\'s wrestling — her long-time friend, the late Fabulous Moolah. Young and Burke both helped train Moolah, who would become the longest-reigning champion in sports-entertainment history and the first female WWE Hall of Famer. Another of Young\'s most famous students was Ric Drasin, a former rock and roll guitarist and sports-entertainer who was also a one-time training partner of Arnold Schwarzenegger.While she continued to compete, Young\'s career was relatively unheralded until the turn of the 21st century. In 1999, she and Fabulous Moolah made an appearance on SmackDown; although it wasn\'t the most successful — Moolah was laid out by a guitar while Young felt the Figure-Four Leglock — it began a \"second career\" for the two legends.Over the next few years, Young made semi-regular appearances on WWE programming, and was never afraid to take chances that many might be afraid to. After all, how many women — or men, for that matter — in their mid-seventies would survive being powerbombed through a table? In addition, she entered and won the \"Miss Royal Rumble\" competition in 2000, and stood faithfully at her best friend\'s side when Moolah won her final Women\'s Championship. Young also had a humorous tryst with Mark Henry during that time that fostered some of the most bizarre moments in sports-entertainment history.In later years, Young\'s career got the recognition it deserved. In 2005, she and several of her contemporaries were profiled in \"Lipstick and Dynamite,\" a documentary film about the early pioneers of women\'s wrestling. In 2008, Young joined co-star, trainee and late friend Moolah and \"Sensational\" Sherri Martel in the highest class of Superstars, as she became only the third female (at the time) to be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. Young was inducted by good friend Pat Patterson, who told some stories that are better left unpublished but just go to show what kind of character Mae Young really was. When Mae Young passed away on Jan. 14, 2014, the entire WWE Universe stood in unison to offer an ovation to a true queen of the canvas.');

As The Rockers, Marty Jannetty and Shawn Michaels paved the way for a new competitive style, proving that leaner and faster Superstars could hold their own inside the squared circle.One of the most exciting duos in WWE history, Jannetty and Michaels first joined forces in NWA very early in their careers. The daredevil style of both competitors made them an exciting duo to watch and also earned them two World Tag Team Championships during their time in AWA. Making their way to WWE in 1988, they immediately began intense rivalries with tag teams such as Demolition and The Hart Foundation.In 1991, the duo famously split up after Michaels threw his partner through a window on “The Barbershop” after Jannetty accidentally caused HBK’s elimination at Survivor Series. Although The Rockers were no more, Jannetty embarked on a career as a singles competitor, defeating his former tag team partner for the Intercontinental Championship in 1993.After losing the prized title back to Michaels a few weeks later, Jannetty refocused his energy on the tag team division, setting his sights on the World Tag Team Championship  —  an accomplishment that eluded him during his time as a Rocker. It was on the Jan. 10, 1994, Raw that Jannetty finally captured the World Tag Team Title, teaming with The 1-2-3 Kid to defeat The Quebecers.Following his tag title reign, Jannetty briefly competed in ECW in 1995 before returning to WWE and once against focusing on tag team competition. As Shawn Michaels’ popularity sky-rocketed, Jannetty formed The New Rockers alongside Leif Cassidy and his rivalry with HBK continued. The New Rockers were unable to build any momentum, however, and Jannetty left WWE in 1996.Throughout the late 1990s, Jannetty competed in WCW’s lauded cruiserweight division and returned to ECW. The former Rocker eventually returned to WWE in 2005 to reunite with Shawn Michaels and compete in a memorable match against Kurt Angle.

After successful ambushes in a hotel room and arena parking lot, Pete Gas pinned Crash at the Newark Liberty International Airport baggage claim to give the Posse their first taste of championship gold.Pete’s reign lasted only a matter of moments, but during a Hardcore Battle Royal at WrestleMania 2000, each member of the Posse enjoyed a brief reign with the title. Further attempts by the bumbling trio to regain the title, including dressing as clowns and attacking Crash outside a circus, came up fruitless.These days, the Posse works in ventures outside the wrestling ring, but they still show up to work in sweaters and khakis.');

In 1994, he traveled to Sarajevo for what was supposed to be a six-week assignment covering the siege of the city by Serbian forces. The assignment turned into a nine-month, life-changing experience that saw him report daily from a war-torn city, ducking snipers and mortar shells at every turn.

Her early days were unremarkable, but McCool refused to be held back, because she had struggled for too long to get where she was.Before she ever stepped in the ring, Michelle was a teacher in Florida. She spent her days educating schoolchildren about science, but she always knew what she really wanted to do with her life. From the day she attended a WWE event with her father and grandfather when she was six years old, McCool vowed she would be a sports-entertainer. The little girl set eyes on the \"American Dream\" Dusty Rhodes and she was hooked.Living by the motto \"Faith to fight the good fight, heart to believe and soul to search within,\" McCool battled her way from Diva Search reject to the top of the division. At first wasted as the manager of a forgettable tag team known as The Teacher\'s Pets, McCool began to carve her own path when she set out as a singles competitor. Early matches weren\'t always pretty, but her perseverance paid off in July of 2008 when she defeated Natalya to become the first-ever Divas Champion.The victory was a huge one for the Florida native and it inspired a change in her. No longer was she concerned with pleasing the fans. Instead, her main goal was to stay on top of the Divas division at any cost. It was a shocking change of personality, but a shift that brought McCool more accolades. In June of 2009, she defeated Melina at The Bash to capture the Women\'s Title, becoming the first competitor to win both the Divas and Women\'s Championship. On that night, her legacy as a historic Diva was cemented.From there, McCool formed an alliance with the equally nasty Layla. Collectively known as Team Lay-Cool, the mean girls became the wickedest duo in WWE. Like two nasty high school students, they resorted to namecalling to belittle the other Divas in the locker room and found every way to cheat to hold on to the Divas Championship they shared.They were evil, but effective. That was until WrestleMania XXVII when Team Lay-Cool was put in their place by \"Jersey Shore\" star Snooki. The loss stung and led to the eventual breakup of McCool and Layla.

These “three faces of Foley” were dangerously unique, but all shared a common trait — a willingness to always go one step too far.Inspired to become a Superstar after watching Jimmy Snuka leap from the top of a steel cage in Madison Square Garden, Mick Foley adopted Superfly’s fearlessness when he entered the ring himself. As Cactus Jack, he earned a fan following not for winning matches, but for surviving them. In a bout against the punishing Big Van Vader in Germany, Foley’s ear was torn off. In Japan, he suffered third degree burns in an exploding ring. Still, no matter what he suffered through, Foley would keep fighting back.When he came to WWE in 1996, he turned into Mankind, a deranged miscreant who lurked in boiler rooms and shoved his fingers down opponents’ throats. Under the leather mask of this maniac, Foley lived through sports-entertainment’s most shocking moment when he was thrown off the top of the Hell in a Cell by The Undertaker. The unforgettable image of Foley’s body artlessly plummeting to the ground below defined not only his career, but WWE’s “Attitude Era” as a whole.A funny thing happened after Foley’s fall, though. Battered and bruised after years of punishment, he began to depend less on his threshold for pain and more on his sense of humor, intelligence and surprisingly vulnerable nature. His toothless sneer became a cheesy smile. His trusty 2-by-4 wrapped in barbwire was replaced by a sock puppet named Mr. Socko. Now a fan favorite, Foley thrilled audiences by beating The Rock for the WWE Title in 1999 and surprised them even more when he published his insightful, New York Times-bestselling autobiography “Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks.” Later teaming with The Great One as The Rock ‘n’ Sock Connection, Foley brought Raw some of its highest television ratings ever during his inspired interactions with The People’s Champion.In 2000, Foley was sent into retirement after losing a Hell in a Cell Match to Triple H, but he has since returned to WWE as a commissioner, a color commentator and even a competitor, most notably against Edge at WrestleMania 22. Now known as The Hardcore Legend, Foley was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame on April 6, 2013, in Madison Square Garden, proving he\'d achieved more than he\'d ever dreamed on that night he watched Snuka take the leap.Foley returned to WWE TV the night before the 2016 WWE Brand Extension Draft as Stephanie McMahon’s choice for Raw General Manager.

And thanks to his role as an enforcer during the WWE Title Match at WrestleMania XIV, Mike Tyson is not only a pop-culture icon, but an important part of WWE history.One of boxing’s greatest and most intimidating champions, \"Iron Mike\" exploded on the scene in the mid-1980s, dispatching of opponents in record time — and in terrifying fashion. In his first professional fight in 1985, the 18-year-old laid the groundwork for what would become a path of destruction as he flattened his opponent in the first round. Known for his lightning-fast hands and uncanny defensive abilities, the knockout artist would go on to win his first 22 fights — all but one via KO.At only 20 years old, Tyson became the youngest heavyweight champion in the sport\'s history when he defeated Trevor Berbick in ’86. From there, “Iron Mike’s” standing as a powerful and destructive puncher was so widespread that opponents were actually scared to face him. This intimidating presence helped Tyson become one of the world’s richest and most famous athletes.After living up to his moniker as “The Baddest Man on the Planet” in the boxing ring, Tyson helped WrestleMania XIV live up to its billing as “The Greatest Extravaganza of All Time.” Serving as the special enforcer in the massive showdown between WWE Champion Shawn Michaels and “Stone Cold” Steve Austin, Tyson caused a media circus to surround The Show of Shows in 1998.First welcomed into WWE by Mr. McMahon, “Iron Mike’s” introduction was interrupted by The Texas Rattlesnake, resulting in a wild brawl between the two tough guys. Weeks later, Tyson aligned himself with HBK and D-Generation X. WWE fans who thought this association would sway the brawler’s involvement at WrestleMania XIV were shocked when Tyson ended up being the one who counted the pin to give Austin his first WWE Title. After the bout, the heavy hitter knocked an angry Michaels out cold in front of a rabid Boston crowd.Following his scene-stealing turn in the blockbuster comedy, “The Hangover,” Tyson returned to WWE in 2010 as the guest host of Raw where the former fighter clearly reveled being back in the ring. In his first-ever match, Tyson teamed with Chris Jericho to battle Triple H & HBK. Before the match was over, Tyson revealed his true allegiance to DX before silencing his mouthy opponent with a trademark right hand.A lifelong WWE enthusiast, Mike Tyson’s contributions to WWE are legendary, and he’s earned his place next to the greatest performers of all time in the celebrity wing of the WWE Hall of Fame.');

Athletic, colorful and explosive in the ring, “The Man of 1,000 Masks” established himself as a major attraction in the United States, Japan and other corners of the globe in the 1970s and paved the way for the future success of Mexican competitors like Rey Mysterio, Eddie Guerrero and his nephew Alberto Del Rio.Making his ring debut in Guadalajara in the mid-1960s, the competitor quickly became a cultural phenomenon thanks to a 1966 film that presented his origin story. Entitled Mil Máscaras, the movie revealed that the mystery man was actually an orphan who was raised by a team of scientists to become a superhuman athlete. Following the picture’s success, other more outlandish films followed, including 1968’s Las Momias de Guanajuato, which featured the luchador battling mummies while wearing his trademark mask.The fans who lined up at movie theaters to watch Mil Máscaras rumble with the undead also paid to see him compete in the ring, which translated to major box-office success for the agile grappler. This ability to draw a crowd had promoters clamoring for his name on the card, leading Mil Máscaras to make his U.S. debut in Los Angeles in 1968.With his high-flying dives and dazzling flips, the Mexican competitor was an exciting change of pace for the California crowds who were more accustomed to the ground based attacks of grapplers like John Tolos and Gene LeBell. The colorful masks of Mil Máscaras also set him apart from his opponents in their dull boots and trunks. In fact, he rarely wore the same hood twice.As his reputation grew, Mil Máscaras made his way to Tokyo where his wild offense and flashy ring gear inspired a whole new generation of competitors in Japan. Legends like Tiger Mask and Ultimo Dragon may have never existed had it not been for Mil Máscaras.In 1972, the luchador made history again when he became the first masked man to perform in Madison Square Garden. Up until that point, an antiquated New York law had prevented grapplers from competing under a hood in the arena, but the rule was finally overturned so that WWE could feature the Mexican sensation. Throughout the decade, Mil Máscaras continued to be a big draw for the sports-entertainment powerhouse and came very close to becoming WWE Champion during a series of competitive matches with “Superstar” Billy Graham.In demand all over the world, Mil Máscaras rarely stayed in the same place for long, preferring to move on to the next challenge. During his amazing and unpredictable career, the warrior challenged Harley Race for the NWA Championship in Japan, battled Cactus Jack at WCW’s Clash of the Champions and even competed in the 1997 Royal Rumble where he had the unique distinction of eliminating himself from the bout.Celebrating his 69th birthday in 2011, Mil Máscaras continued to do what he does best, locking up for sporadic bouts in Japan and Mexico and stepping in front of the cameras for his latest supernatural thriller. Although he can still compete himself, the masked sensation can also step back and admire the many Superstars he impacted and influenced.It’s a long and proud legacy that has earned Mil Máscaras millions of admirers and admission into the WWE Hall of Fame Class of 2012.');

Hundreds of men tried to pin down the feisty female, though few ever succeeded. Women didn’t fare much better; Burke captured the Women’s World Championship shortly after her debut, and she held onto it for two decades. Foes like Gladys “Kill ‘Em” Gillem and WWE Hall of Famer Mae Young tried to dethrone Burke, but came up short every time.Burke was also regarded as having an ideal physique in her heyday.

The two could not have been any more different; Savage was loud, in-your-face and cocky, while Elizabeth rarely spoke a word. But it was her loyalty to \"Macho Man\" that showed just how incredible a woman Elizabeth truly was.Despite Savage\'s rule-breaking ways, Elizabeth remained faithful. Even when he crushed the larynx of Ricky Steamboat, she stood by her man. It was that devotion that eventually paid off for the duo professionally, as she became a calming influence to Savage, eventually guiding \"Macho Man\" to the WWE Championship at WrestleMania IV.Miss Elizabeth was also an instrumental piece in bringing together The Mega Powers, Savage & Hulk Hogan. Although Savage\'s jealousy over Elizabeth\'s friendship with Hogan eventually imploded The Mega Powers, the duo was highly successful in their time together, and Elizabeth deserves credit for keeping the two Superstars in sync.On a personal level, the partnership between Miss Elizabeth and Randy Savage became much more than Superstar-manager when their unlikely romance blossomed. Our fans will never forget the image from WrestleMania VII when a concerned Elizabeth jumped the railing and ran to the ring to defend Savage -- who was being attacked by Sensational Sherri after losing a Retirement Match. Elizabeth showed her true spirit when she threw Sherri from the ring to protect \"Macho Man.\" Shocked by her reemergence, Savage hoisted Miss Elizabeth high on his shoulder as those in attendance wept at the emotional moment.The devotion Miss Elizabeth and Randy Savage showed each other over their years together would fully blossom at SummerSlam 1991, when the two entered into marriage. Reunited with Elizabeth, \"Macho Man\" would come out of retirement and once again capture the WWE Championship, this time at WrestleMania VIII. And although Elizabeth was banned from ringside, she rushed to be by Savage\'s side to watch his victory.After four years away from the ring, Elizabeth would return to manage Randy Savage in WCW in 1996. She would also branch out and enjoy time alongside the Four Horsemen, but would spend most of her WCW days as a member of the nWo, aligned once more with \"Macho Man\" and Hulk Hogan.

Victoria was responsible for the most embarrassing moment in Molly\'s career when she defeated her in a Hair vs. Title Match at WrestleMania XX. It was unheard of for a Diva to participate in a Hair vs. Title Match, especially on the grandest stage of them all. Fans howled and Molly shrieked when Victoria shaved a restrained Molly bald.

Known for keeping bags of salt well-hidden in his trunks, the talented Fuji made himself that much more dangerous by employing this secret weapon. Alongside partner Professor Toru Tanaka, Mr. Fuji was a World Tag Team Champion three times, as he and Tanaka reigned supreme in the tag division in the early ‘70s. On one occasion, Fuji & Tanaka held the titles for nearly a year, and during their second run as champions they held the gold for almost six months.

Mr. Fuji would interfere in the match at WrestleMania IX, throwing his trademark salt into the eyes of Hart, allowing Yokozuna to win the WWE Championship. Moments later, an ecstatic Fuji, with years of revenge on his mind, would brazenly challenge Hulk Hogan to enter the ring and fight \"my Yokozuma.\" He called Hogan a \"yellow belly,\" to which Hulkster responded by winning the title. Fuji later managed Yokozuna to another title run, as well as a World Tag Team Championship with Owen Hart.Mr. Fuji slowly faded out of the spotlight and retired from the squared circle, but not before making one last appearance at WrestleMania XII to accompany Yokozuna to the ring. A decade later, on the eve of WrestleMania 23, it was longtime charge Muraco who put Fuji into the pantheon of the elite when he inducted his former manager into the WWE Hall of Fame.His career will be remembered by different generations for different reasons, but one constant will be an indelible mark — Mr. Fuji, whether as a wrestler or manager, is one of the most successful performers ever to set foot in a WWE ring.');

His dropkicks were textbook, his Perfectplex was near inescapable. He brought the Intercontinental Title a new level of credibility during his two reigns and set a higher standard for technical wrestling in WWE when he defended the championship against Bret “Hit Man” Hart at SummerSlam 1991. In his prime, the man was the pinnacle of a sports-entertainer from his curly blonde hair right down to his spotless white boots.The son of Minnesota wrestling legend Larry \"The Axe\" Hennig, Curt first grabbed the attention of sports-entertainment fans as a top star in Verne Gagne\'s American Wrestling Association. These were important steps in Hennig’s development as an in-ring talent, but his legacy would be defined by his time in WWE.Heavily hyped by a series of vignettes that showed him doing everything from bowling a perfect game to hitting a home run, Hennig went undefeated for a year when he debuted in ’88. After nearly winning the 1990 Royal Rumble, Perfect linked up with Bobby “The Brain” Heenan and captured the vacant Intercontinental Title. A two-time champion, his most enduring moment with the title was in a loss to Bret Hart at SummerSlam in 1991 in a match often marked as the finest in that event’s history. Even in defeat, Perfect was at the top of his game.Nagging injuries led Hennig to take a break from competition and adapt to new roles as both an “executive consultant” to Ric Fair and a commentator. In 1996, he even led Triple H to his first Intercontinental Championship before leaving WWE for WCW. Here, Hennig joined the legendary Four Horsemen, but quickly defected to the villainous New World Order. In 1999, Hennig severed his ties with the nWo and joined up with Kendall & Barry Windham and Bobby Duncum, Jr. in a group of good old boys dubbed The West Texas Rednecks. Butting heads with a hip hop group known as The No Limit Soldiers, Hennig and company recorded a toe tapper called “Rap is Crap” and became unexpected fan favorites in the process.Hennig returned to WWE for the final time in 2002, competing in the Royal Rumble Match and making it to the final four. It was Mr. Perfect’s last great showing in the squared circle as he passed away in 2003 at the age of 44.

While starring on one of television’s biggest hits, the gold-covered brawler joined up with his “Rocky III” co-star Hulk Hogan in WWE in 1985.With “The Rock ‘n’ Wrestling Connection” in full swing, Mr. T appeared on the groundbreaking The War to Settle the Score on MTV. In a melee following Hogan’s battle against Roddy Piper, T hopped into the ring and backed The Hulkster in a standoff with Piper and Paul Orndorff. In the weeks that followed, the pair made major television appearances on “The Morning Show” with Regis Philbin and “Saturday Night Live” alongside Billy Crystal before defeating Piper and Orndorff in the historic main event of the very first WrestleMania.The following year, T rekindled his rivalry with Hot Rod and defeated Piper in a Boxing Match in one of WrestleMania 2’s three main events. In 1987, T was named WWE’s new Special Enforcer, a position that allowed him to mind the antics of The Honky Tonk Man and Bobby Heenan.When Hogan debuted for WCW in 1994, Mr. T joined his longtime friend. He was the referee for many of The Immortal One’s big matches, including a title defense in a steel cage at Halloween Havoc. He even defeated noted brawler Kevin Sullivan at Starrcade.

That shameless self-promotion led WWE officials to sign MVP to the most lucrative contract in the history of the blue brand — a big money deal that inundated the Superstar’s early WWE tenure with questions of: “Is he worth it?”Although his unproven arrogance — not to mention the bizarre bodysuit he competed in — did little to endear him to the WWE Universe, MVP proved himself by surviving a vicious series of matches against the demonic Kane and grabbing the United States Championship within months of his debut — a title he held for an astounding 343 days.An ensuing rivalry with Matt Hardy became MVP’s claim to fame as the two Superstars competed in arm wrestling matches and pizza eating contests in a never-ending game of one-upmanship. While at odds, the foes unexpectedly won the WWE Tag Team Titles, putting two championships in the hands of MVP simultaneously.After losing his U.S. Title to Hardy, the so-called “ballin’ ” Superstar’s career hit a snag with an embarrassing losing streak that lasted from summer 2008 through April of the following year. The disappointing run did little for MVP’s reputation, but the humbling reality of his win-loss record allowed a more truthful side of his persona to shine through. Stepping out from behind his designer sunglasses and shiny platinum chains, the braggadocios competitor revealed himself to be an inspiring figure who turned his life around after serving time in prison as a young man.MVP was cheered on by WWE fans during his final years with the company as he enjoyed another reign as United States Champion and formed an impressive tag team with the mighty Mark Henry.

Some are born to it and some are brought to it, but they all leave a mark that nobody will ever forget. Their successes aren\'t measured just by the championships they won, but also by the legacy they create in the ring for future stars of the business to follow.Nick Bockwinkel is such a man. He broke into sports-entertainment in the mid-1950s after ending his football career at the University of Oklahoma. Early in his sports-entertainment career, he was under the tutelage of his famous father, Warren, and wrestling legend Lou Thesz. Nick teamed with his father numerous times in the ring, competing in Georgia, Texas and the Pacific Northwest before moving on to the place he would find the most success: the American Wrestling Association. It was in the AWA that he formed a devastating tag team with Ray \"The Crippler\" Stevens. Managed by WWE Hall of Famer Bobby Heenan, Bockwinkel & Stevens would capture their first AWA World Tag Team Championship in 1972, and would go on to hold the titles a total of three times.After his successes as a tag team wrestler, Bockwinkel broke out into singles competition, ready to take AWA by storm. After working his way up the rankings, Bockwinkel shocked the world in 1975 when he defeated another WWE Hall of Famer, Verne Gagne, to become AWA World Champion. The win ended Gagne\'s seven-year reign as AWA champion.Bockwinkel infuriated AWA fans for close to five years as the champion. He became one of, if not the most hated wrestlers of all-time. Bockwinkel often remarked, \"I am the smartest wrestler alive.\" However, his arrogance could not detract from the talent he displayed in the ring, as he took on all challengers.Bockwinkel would have rivalries with some of the most talented wrestlers of all-time as the champion of AWA. From AWA Legends like Gagne, Mad Dog Vachon and Dick The Bruiser to world-renowned Superstars such as Terry Funk, Larry Zbyszko and Bruiser Brody to fellow Hall of Famers Jerry Lawler, Andre The Giant and Hulk Hogan, Bockwinkel was not afraid to put the gold on the line against anyone. He would hold the AWA World Heavyweight Championship a total of four times, his last reign being ended by fellow 2007 WWE Hall of Fame inductee Curt Hennig in May 1987.During his time as champion, Bockwinkel also made history as a participant in two of the greatest matches in wrestling history. On March 25, 1979, he challenged then-WWE Champion Bob Backlund in the first-ever \"unification\" match between an AWA and WWE Champion. The historic match went to a double-countout, and is still regarded as one of the best of all-time. In 1986, Bockwinkel would again make history as he faced then-NWA World Heavyweight Champion Ric Flair in the final AWA match in the Winnipeg Arena.The late Bockwinkel also enjoyed stardom outside the ring, making appearances on The Monkees, Hawaii Five-O and even Hollywood Squares, where he won $1,300 and a new kitchen. Bockwinkel would also step out of the ring and serve as the Commissioner of WCW in 1994.It was only fitting that when Bockwinkel was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2007, it was longtime manager Bobby Heenan who sent him into the Hall. And of course, Heenan was in rare form, telling the audience that \"Bockwinkel was a great guy and never did anything wrong...so he couldn\'t have played in the NBA or the NFL right?\"Nick Bockwinkel took the traditions of pioneers in wrestling, such as his father Warren and Lou Thesz, and transformed them to his liking during his career. It was those ideals that made Bockwinkel a true visionary in his own right, and laid the foundations for the Superstars of today.

In addition, Patterson was linked to many \"firsts\" in the industry, as his voice and his mind helped him continue his career well after his in-ring days were over.Patterson began his career in 1958 in his native Montreal before moving on to the San Francisco promotion. Patterson was a fixture in the Bay Area for nearly two decades, winning the regional tag team championship there an unprecedented 10 times with seven different partners, and also twice winning the legendary Cow Palace Battle Royal (in 1975 and 1981).It was in San Francisco where he first met and teamed with Ray Stevens, and the pair moved on to the AWA in the late 1970s. They won the AWA World Tag Team Championship in 1978, but after losing the gold a year later, Patterson moved on to WWE.He made an almost immediate impact after falling under the tutelage of The Grand Wizard. In September 1979, Patterson won a tournament in Rio de Janeiro to become the first Intercontinental Champion. He held the gold until 1980, when he split with The Wizard and became a fan favorite.In 1981, Patterson\'s rivalry with Sgt. Slaughter became one of the biggest in WWE. The two brutalized each other every chance they got in a series of Boot Camp Matches, with their rivalry culminating in a brutal Alley Fight at Madison Square Garden that April.During that time, Patterson also began his career as a color commentator, teaming up with Vince McMahon to announce WWE Championship Wrestling. Patterson continued to do double-duty in the ring and behind the mic until his official retirement in 1984.That didn\'t stop him from contributing to WWE, however. He took a role as a WWE Official, and became one of McMahon\'s close confidantes. In 1988, one of Patterson\'s greatest ideas came to life in the form of the Royal Rumble Match; while it has been modified and expanded since its debut, the Royal Rumble Match format itself is an idea credited to Patterson.A decade later, his close relationship with McMahon would bring Patterson back to WWE television; alongside Gerald Brisco, Patterson served as one of McMahon\'s advisors (or \"stooges,\" as our fans might call them). Patterson & Brisco did a lot of dirty work for the WWE Chairman in the late 1980s, and Patterson would become part of more history during that time.In June 2000, Patterson became the oldest man to ever win the Hardcore Championship. Over 20 years after making history with the Intercontinental Championship, Patterson pinned Crash Holly to claim Hardcore gold. At King of the Ring that year, Patterson met Brisco in an infamous Hardcore Evening Gown Match; unfortunately for Patterson, Holly took advantage of the \"24/7 Rule\" to join the match and regain the gold, ending Pat\'s reign after only a week. Patterson would soon go back to being a faithful McMahon ally, remaining with WWE in an official backstage capacity for another five years.For all his efforts, Pat Patterson was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1996 by Bret Hart, another one of Canada\'s finest sports-entertainers. In his 25-plus years in WWE, Patterson was synonymous with making history. From the Intercontinental Title to the Royal Rumble Match and beyond, his name will forever be revered in WWE lore. ');

Together for more than a decade, the trio stomped through territories all over the globe, winning titles wherever they went and leaving behind a path of destruction that was not soon forgotten.The man known as \"Precious\" Paul Ellering was not always a manager, though. A champion powerlifter, the Minnesota native joined the American Wrestling Association in the mid-70s after surviving one of Verne Gagne\'s brutal training camps. He competed in all the major territories after that, locking up with WWE Hall of Famers like Jesse Ventura and Jerry \"The King\" Lawler in hard-hitting matches. But his career would hit a premature end after a series of knee injuries left him unable to perform at the top level. Still, Ellering had personality and could talk. Naturally, he became a manager.Clad in sharp clothes with a copy of the Wall Street Journal rolled up in his hand, Ellering was clinical and cerebral — a perfect counterpart to the bombastic Hawk & Animal. The three men first linked up in Georgia Championship Wrestling in 1983. From there, it was a campaign of global domination. They smashed The Crusher & Baron Von Raschke in Wisconsin and massacred The Midnight Express in Pennsylvania. Ellering promised annihilation on the microphone and The Road Warriors delivered it in the ring. Fans came out by the thousands to see the team, and before long Hawk, Animal and Ellering weren\'t just part of the show — they were the show.The Road Warriors have credited \"Precious\" Paul for much of this monumental success. They may have had the raw talent, but their manager was the man who was able to mold them into unstoppable wrecking machines. Ellering didn\'t simply stand in the team\'s corner — he booked their appearances, set up their travel arrangements, managed their finances and made them into a showcase attraction like Andre the Giant or Bruiser Brody. His shrewd negotiation skills allowed The Road Warriors to name their price wherever they went. Ellering even took the team overseas, where they became one of the wealthiest and most successful teams in the history of All Japan Pro Wrestling.In 1992, Ellering joined his team in WWE. Now known as The Legion of Doom, the powerhouses were as dominant as always — even if Ellering now employed a ventriloquist dummy named Rocco to help in his decision making. Things weren\'t always perfect. The Road Warriors once violently fired Ellering in WCW and he infamously turned on Hawk & Animal to join Disciples of Apocalypse in 1997. But in the end, those incidents hardly mattered. The Road Warriors and Paul Ellering are now remembered as one of the greatest alliances in sports-entertainment history. And just as he led the team to the top in the \'80s and \'90s, he led them into the WWE Hall of Fame Class of 2011.However, his induction into the WWE Hall of Fame isn\'t where Ellering\'s storied career ends. The mastermind behind The Road Warrriors returned to WWE in 2016, arriving in NXT with a pair of absolute monsters in tow. The titans, known as The Authors of Pain, demolished American Alpha to make a statement at NXT TakeOver: The End of The Beginning. Ellering is keeping his motives a secret for the moment, though the NXT Universe can clearly see that one thing is certainly in his plans: destruction. ');

From becoming the first-ever WWE \"Triple Crown\" Champion to his induction into the Hall of Fame, Morales\' near 30-year career is one full of history.Born on Culebra Island, just off the shore of the Puerto Rican mainland, Pedro Morales moved to Brooklyn, N.Y., as a child and began to foster dreams of becoming a sports-entertainer. That dream came true in 1959, as Morales — still only a teenager —made his debut in his new hometown of New York City.In the ring, his style could be described as workmanlike — that is, until he lost his temper. Then, all bets were off, and his opponents were in trouble. A tremendously powerful puncher, Morales was also well versed in the technical aspects of the game and utilized the Boston Crab better than anyone in the business. He prided himself on being in tremendous condition and often won his bouts by simply wearing out his opponents.Morales soon headed out west, where he dominated the Los Angeles and San Francisco circuits in the 1960s en route to racking up numerous regional championships. In 1970, however, he headed back home to New York City and WWE, where he would finally burst into national prominence.On Feb. 8, 1971 — less than a year after joining WWE — Morales avenged friend Bruno Sammartino and defeated Ivan Koloff in Madison Square Garden to win the WWE Championship. Already incredibly popular, Morales drew rabid crowds every time he returned to his hometown, which had a large and loyal Puerto Rican fan base. One of his most memorable matches came at Shea Stadium, as he and former WWE Champion Sammartino battled to a classic 75-minute draw.Shortly after losing the gold in late-1973, Morales headed to the NWA, where he continued his successful ways. Pedro earned numerous regional NWA championships and also spent some time in his native Puerto Rico, where he held tag team gold with another Puerto Rican legend — Carlos Colon.Morales returned to WWE in 1980, and soon after, he made history once again at Shea Stadium. On August 9 of that year, Morales & then-WWE Champion Bob Backlund defeated The Wild Samoans to win the World Tag Team Championship; unfortunately, because WWE Superstars were forbidden to hold multiple championships at the time, they had to relinquish the gold almost immediately.No matter for Pedro, who went onto further singles stardom. Just four months later, he once again etched his name in the annals of sports-entertainment by defeating Ken Patera for the Intercontinental Championship. With the win, Morales became the first Superstar to accomplish the career \"Triple Crown\" by winning the WWE, Intercontinental and World Tag Team Championships. He would go on to become a two-time Intercontinental Champion, dropping and regaining the title from Don Muraco during their intense 1981 rivalry.After losing the gold a second time, Morales continued to be one of WWE\'s most popular Superstars, but would never again wear a championship. He nearly won the King of the Ring tournament in both 1985 and 1986 -- losing to Harley Race in the 1986 finals -- before finally hanging up his boots for good in 1987. Soon after retirement, however, Morales segued his popularity into a short career in the broadcast booth, where he became a Spanish-language commentator for WWE events.In 1995, Morales was given his place among the all-time greats when he was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. His induction was presented by fellow Puerto Rican Superstar Savio Vega.Because Morales was a soft-spoken man who didn\'t do outrageous things, he is sometimes overlooked when the names of the all-time greats are mentioned. However, in addition to being one of the greatest to ever set foot in a ring, Morales was loved by the public and well-respected by his peers.

He wasn’t even 5 years old when he watched his father knock out “Mr. Wonderful” Paul Orndorff in the main event at the inaugural WrestleMania.When he arrived in WWE, Triple H and Ric Flair groomed him early on, welcoming him into their elite faction, Evolution. Under their tutelage, the 24-year-old Orton became the youngest World Heavyweight Champion and he only kept going from there. Not only did Orton cement himself as a “Legend Killer” by dispatching WWE’s most decorated in-ring veterans, he became the centerpiece of two more factions, Legacy and The Authority, all en route to unifying the WWE and World Heavyweight Titles to become the first WWE World Heavyweight Champion in history.Which isn’t to say Orton is content with being known as a team player. You don’t get a name like The Apex Predator for being friendly, and Orton certainly does not play well with others. Friend and foe alike have felt the sting of his RKO or the boom of his dreaded punt, and well into his second decade as a WWE Superstar, there’s no telling who comes next.

His style — perfectly punctuated by his entrance music, \"Pomp and Circumstance\" — was only outshined by his performances in the ring, which led him to two WWE Championships, four WCW World Championships and a 14-month reign as Intercontinental Champion.Born Randy Poffo, son of wrestling Legend, Angelo Poffo, Macho Man almost chose Major League Baseball over World Wrestling Entertainment. Poffo was signed by the St. Louis Cardinals as a catcher upon graduating high school. After years developing in the minor leagues, a home plate collision caused an injury to his throwing arm, ending his baseball career.Following in his father’s footsteps, Randy Poffo debuted as a wrestler in 1973 as a character named “The Spider” who looked like Spider-Man. This was prophetic, as Randy Savage later scored a role as wrestler “Bone Saw” McGraw in the 2002 motion picture, Spider-Man. It wasn’t until Georgia Championship Wrestling matchmaker Ole Anderson told Poffo that his name didn’t resemble his savage wrestling style that the name Randy Savage became known to fans.Joining WWE in June of 1985, Macho Man\'s impact was such that his services were in demand by the various managers in WWE at that time. But Savage introduced a young woman named Elizabeth to accompany him to the ring and manage him. With the First Lady of Wrestling as his manager, the Superstar’s first major achievement was reaching the finals of a one-night tournament, as part of the Wrestling Classic pay-per-view event in November of 1985. The following February, after a lengthy rivalry with then-Intercontinental Champion Tito Santana, Macho Man defeated the WWE Hall of Famer to earn his first WWE title.Savage became a WrestleMania staple early on, making his debut on The Grandest Stage of Them All at WrestleMania 2 where he defended the Intercontinental Championship against the intimidating and unpredictable George \"The Animal\" Steele. From there, he defended the title all the way until WrestleMania III, when he fell short to Ricky Steamboat in what is considered by many to be one of the greatest matches of all time.Success continued to coincide with Macho Man in 1988, when he won a huge tournament at WrestleMania IV to earn his first WWE Championship. During his reign as champion, he and Hulk Hogan formed one of the most formidable tandems to ever step foot in a ring. The Mega Powers were virtually unstoppable by anyone — except for themselves. A misunderstanding and a touch of jealousy sent Savage into a rage at NBC\'s The Main Event, leading him to attack his tag team partner. The two took their differences to the ring at WrestleMania V, when Hogan won back the WWE Championship.Savage went on to dub himself \"Macho King\" after defeating \"Hacksaw\" Jim Duggan for the King of the Ring title in 1989. Carrying a scepter and crown, he called on Sensational Sherri to replace Elizabeth as his manager. Savage targeted then-WWE Champion Ultimate Warrior with a series of attacks in response to being denied a title opportunity, which led to a Career-Ending Match at WrestleMania VII. When Savage was pinned, Sherri attacked him as he lay helpless. Fortunately, Elizabeth was in the audience and rushed to his aid, sparking arguably the most romantic moment the WWE Universe had ever witnessed. The sight of Miss Elizabeth and Macho Man embarking in the center of the ring after all those years was one of the fans would not soon forget..WrestleMania VII\'s romance may have been topped at SummerSlam 1991. That was when WWE’s favorite couple was married in a special ceremony dubbed the \"Match Made in Heaven.”Macho Man returned to the ring shortly after and eventually earned an opportunity for a second reign as WWE Champion at WrestleMania VIII against Ric Flair. Savage was successful in earning the perfect accessory to match his golden attire, and he also put to rest Flair’s false claims that he and Elizabeth were having an affair. After his run as champion, Macho Man sat next to Mr. McMahon and served as color commentator for the premiere season of Monday Night Raw in 1993.After defecting to WCW during the infamous Monday Night War, Savage won his first WCW World Championship, winning WCW\'s first-ever 60-Man Three-Ring Battle Royal in 1995. He would lose the title a month later to his rival, Flair, only to win it back from him for a second reign in early 1996.Four years later, after a ring career that spanned back to 1973, Savage left the squared circle and left a style, a staggering list of accomplishments and a legacy, which can only be described in two words: \"Oooh, yeah!\"Following his untimely passing in 2011, Time Magazine named Macho Man one of their People of the Year. Savage finally took his rightful place in the WWE Hall of Fame in 2015.');

The grungy sociopath terrorized opponents and fans alike in major wrestling organizations including WWE, WCW and the original incarnation of ECW.Raven may have looked like a roadie for Pearl Jam, but he had the brains to become one of the ring’s most influential leaders. With an IQ of more than 140, the gutter punk became a member of Mensa and used his intellect to recruit a cult of followers when Stevie Richards brought him to ECW in 1995. Surrounded by converts like Richards, Blue Meanie, The Pitbulls and Cactus Jack, the sadistic messiah became a villainous idol in Philadelphia by employing a mesmerizing blend of an indomitable demeanor and glib prose. His signature signoff became Edgar Allen Poe’s elegant line, “Quoth the Raven, ‘Nevermore.’ ”The master manipulator first targeted his former summer camp rival Tommy Dreamer, who had been a popular jock while Raven was a social outcast. “For three years, I’d never beat him,” Dreamer said of the man who once broke his fingers in the ring. “Every time I’d come so close, I’d somehow not pull it off.” It wasn’t until two years of battles later that Dreamer finally defeated his longtime rival at Wrestlepalooza 1997, Raven\'s final night in his first ECW tenure.The Sandman, whom Raven twice defeated for the ECW World Championship, became the deranged mastermind’s most emotionally affected victim. In 1996, Raven became involved with The Sandman’s ex-wife and brainwashed The Hardcore Icon’s own 7-year-old son Tyler, who adopted Raven’s wardrobe, mannerisms and phrases and told him, “I love you more than my own daddy.” At one event, the charismatic miscreant assaulted The Sandman in such an offensive manner that Kurt Angle, who was in attendance, stormed out of the ECW Arena in disgust. Raven was later forced to publicly apologize for the brutalization.After arriving in WCW, Raven recruited competitors like Perry Saturn and Billy Kidman to join his sect, now called The Flock. He defeated Diamond Dallas Page for the United States Championship and competed in memorable matches against Goldberg and Chris Jericho before returning to his Extreme roots. Raven’s second tenure in ECW was brief, as he signed with WWE in 2000, where he became a record 26-time Hardcore Champion by defeating Superstars like Big Show and Bradshaw before parting ways with WWE in January 2003.“I loved Raven,” Paul Heyman once proclaimed. “Raven motivated me.

He immediately earned the ire of the WWE Universe, deriding what he saw as a lack of physical fitness among them as he demanded silence while he disrobed. As he revealed his Adonis-like figure, catcalls could be heard from the women in the crowd as they reached for their cameras. Flashbulbs lit up arenas around the world as ladies looked to get a snapshot of their favorite hunk.Ravishing Rick reveled in the attention and strived to draw more to himself. After he removed his glittering robe, Rude’s ring gear was often airbrushed with his smirking visage or the faces of his rivals. This was just one of the ways he got inside the heads of opponents.Following a victory, usually picked up after his devastating “Rude Awakening” neckbreaker, Rude had his trusted manager, Bobby “The Brain” Heenan, pick a lucky lady from the crowd for him to work his magic on, leaving her with a kiss to remember Rude by while he established himself as the alpha male of sports-entertainment.Rude’s machismo led him to believe that any woman could be his at the snap of a finger.

He made an instant impact, defeating Sting for the United States Championship within a month of his debut. Rude went on to capture the WCW International World Title during his stint with the company.He returned to WWE in 1997, trading in his showy attire for a suit and tie. Rude acted as the “insurance policy” for Shawn Michaels and Triple H, the newly-formed D-Generation X while also managing \"The Franchise\" Shane Douglas in ECW.

Donning gold chains and flicking toothpicks at anyone that crossed his path, ”The Bad Guy” made a splash shortly after his debut by helping Ric Flair defeat “Macho Man” Randy Savage for the WWE Title. His biggest WWE moment came soon after when he defeated Shawn Michaels in a landmark Intercontinental Championship Ladder Match at WrestleMania X.The Bad Guy remained a top Superstars throughout his WWE tenure and was usually carrying — or on the hunt for — the Intercontinental Title. During this time, Razor became a key member of the locker room group known as The Kliq. The closely-knit set — consisting of Ramon, X-Pac, Shawn Michaels, Triple H and Diesel — were backstage power players whose influence was felt throughout the entire organization. Their most infamous moment came before Diesel and Razor left WWE when they embraced their supposed rivals — HBK and Triple H —in Madison Square Garden.Shortly after the so-called “Curtain Call,” the former Intercontinental Champion changed the landscape of sports-entertainment forever. With his WWE contract status unknown to the public, Razor appeared unannounced on WCW Monday Nitro on May 27, 1996. After a few weeks of taunting WCW President Eric Bischoff and the organization’s stars, he revealed he wasn’t alone. Kevin Nash — also presumably under WWE contract as Diesel — made his presence felt by powerbombing Bischoff through the entrance stage at The Great American Bash.WCW stars Sting, Lex Luger and “Macho Man” Randy Savage  joined forces to battle Razor — who was now competing under his given name of Scott Hall — and Nash at Bash at the Beach. On that evening, the true intentions of The Outsiders were revealed when Hulk Hogan betrayed WCW and joined the duo, officially giving birth to the most defiant faction in sports-entertainment history — The New World Order.After running roughshod over WCW, the group was brought to WWE by Mr. McMahon in 2002. The trio unleashed hell on the WWE locker room and The Bad Guy set his sights on “Stone Cold” Steve Austin. The two battled at WrestleMania X-8 with Austin claiming victory. Soon after, Hall exited WWE.Though his second tenure in WWE came to an abrupt end, Scott Hall’s influence on sport-entertainment in the final decade of the 20th century cannot be overlooked.

Debuting in mid-1999, the powerhouse took the renegade company by storm as he destroyed Extreme icons like Raven, Tommy Dreamer and The Sandman. Soon, even the highly passionate hardcore fan base began to take notice of the devastating and impactful “GORE!”Rhyno didn’t just defeat opponents. He ended them – barreling through his rivals like a full-steam-ahead locomotive. At CyberSlam 2000, he defeated Yoshihiro Tajiri for the ECW Television Championship. Over the ensuing months, Rhyno defended his title against all comers, including Jerry Lynn, Raven, Mikey Whipwreck, New Jack, Spike Dudley and even Rob Van Dam – who had vacated the title after a 23-month reign – but all were unable to topple The Man Beast.At ECW’s final pay-per-view, Guilty as Charged 2001, Rhyno made history.

The company ceased operations later that month.Rhyno kept moving, and debuted in WWE two months later. He rekindled his longtime friendships with Edge and Christian, and helped his allies win the tag titles at WrestleMania X-Seven. The trio joined with Kurt Angle to form Team RECK, and all four members advanced to the semi-finals of 2001’s King of the Ring Tournament.Staying true to his ECW roots, Rhyno won the Hardcore Championship on three occasions early in his WWE tenure, and joined the ECW portion of The Alliance during 2001’s Invasion.

If Dean Malenko is \"The Man of 1,000 Holds,\" then Flair is absolutely \"The Man of 1,000 Faces\" – each one more flushed red with intensity than the last.There was a time when Flair didn\'t blaze through arenas like a fireball of charisma, but that was before he found his calling as \"The Nature Boy.\" Prior to stealing kisses, flying on jets and riding in limousines, the 16-time World Heavyweight Champion was an adopted, brown-haired kid in Minnesota with a chip on his shoulder.Flair showcased his athletic ability early in life, competing in wrestling, football and track at a boarding school in Wisconsin. After winning the state private school wrestling championship in both 1966 and 1968, he was recruited to the University of Minnesota on a football scholarship. But it wasn\'t until he dropped out that he got his first big opportunity as a sports entertainer.Working as a bouncer at a nightclub, Flair met Olympic weightlifter Ken Patera, who introduced the young \"Slick Ric\" to legendary performer and tough-as-nails trainer Verne Gagne. The 10-time AWA World Heavyweight Champ had quite a class in 1971 for his wrestling camp, which also included Patera, The Iron Sheik and Jim Brunzell. From there, it was simply a matter of time before Flair would start to turn heads with his colorful personality and in-ring prowess.There were no cakewalks in the American Wrestling Association, only battles that tested Flair\'s endurance against combatants like Dusty Rhodes, Andre the Giant and Wahoo McDaniel. Leaving for the Mid-Atlantic region of the National Wrestling Alliance in 1974 looked like a promising choice until a serious plane crash in North Carolina broke his back in three places. At just 26, he was told by doctors that he would never perform again. If Flair was going to defy the odds, he\'d have to not only rehab, but adapt. He\'d have to wave goodbye to the hefty brawler he resembled in the ring and learn how to be a crafty son of a gun – the \"dirtiest player in the game.\"Remarkably, Flair returned to NWA after six months of physical therapy. He won the NWA United States Championship multiple times and picked fights with future legends Ricky Steamboat, Roddy Piper and Jimmy Snuka. In 1978, \"The Nature Boy\" was officially born when Flair challenged the original \"Nature Boy,\" Buddy Rogers. Three years later, he reached new heights by defeating Rhodes for his first NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Along with the title, Flair\'s signature look started to fall into place: designer suits, outlandish robes, and of course, shoes that cost more than your house.As the decade progressed, so did Flair. The spring of \'85 brought the creation of The Four Horsemen, one of the most dominant groups of all time. With Arn Anderson, Ole Anderson and Tully Blanchard by his side, Flair would further cement his legacy when World Championship Wrestling was formed. Classic matches with Steamboat, Terry Funk and Sting ensued, as Flair became the first WCW World Heavyweight Champion while still holding the NWA title.A dispute with then-WCW president Jim Herd in 1991 led \"The Nature Boy\" to his initial stint in WWE, where he would claim his first WWE Championship by lasting nearly 60 minutes in the 1992 Royal Rumble, then win it a second time by toppling Randy Savage. Flair once described this period as \"the greatest year and a half of his career\" outside of his time spent with The Four Horsemen.After returning to WCW in 1993, Slick Ric took on numerous title contenders and led the charge during the notorious invasion of the New World Order. While Monday Nitro became a black-and-white stomping ground, it also featured some of Flair\'s most memorable moments yet. He did whatever it took to get his way, even if it meant stripping in front of a live crowd and handcuffing himself to the ring.Over 50 but still energetic as ever, Flair had an impactful second stint with WWE from 2001 to 2009, doing everything from co-owning WWE for a stretch to joining forces with Triple H to form Evolution. A day before competing in a final, punishing WrestleMania match against Shawn Michaels in 2008, Flair became the first active performer to be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. He became the only two-time inductee in 2012, joining his compatriots in The Four Horsemen in the hallowed Hall.Waiting for Flair to retire first before enshrinement would have been a futile move.

Long viewed as one of WWE’s best looking competitors, the native of Cocoa Beach, Fla. embraced his good looks and entered the world of modeling. “The Model” quickly became in demand with designers in Paris and New York, a fact that Martel was quick to rub in the face of the WWE Universe, pinning an oversized button that read “Yes.

However, Martel’s “Arrogance” came back to bite him. After blinding Jake “The Snake” Roberts with the cologne, Martel got a whiff of his own medicine when officials blindfolded both Superstars at WrestleMania VII to even the playing field. “The Snake” used his reptilian senses to navigate the darkness and get retribution on “The Model” with a DDT.Thankfully, Martel still had his good looks intact after the vicious match with Roberts. However, his position as the most handsome Superstar in WWE would soon be threatened by a young upstart. The Heartbreak Kid, Shawn Michaels, and “The Model” were soon battling over who was better looking — and the affections of Sensational Sherri.Not wanting either Superstar to ruin their looks, Sherri made the two agree that during their clash at SummerSlam 1992, neither could strike each other in the face. That stipulation didn’t hold up, leading Sherri to faint at ringside.Though Martel’s WWE career was winding down by the end of 1992, he still remained a thorn in the side of his fellow competitors. In an effort to stay hip with the latest trends, “The Model” attacked Tatanka and stole his sacred eagle feathers and pinned them to his beret, claiming they were the latest trend in Paris.After making it to the finals of an Intercontinental Championship tournament in 1993 and coming up short, Martel left WWE for WCW where he won the World Television Championship before retiring in July 1998 due to a knee injury.');

The Steiner Brothers captured the WCW Tag Team Titles seven times and the United States Tag Team Titles once, but their success was not entirely limited to the Atlanta-based organization. During their brief time in WWE in the early ’90s, the pair also twice won the WWE Tag Team Championship.Following a short tenure with ECW in 1995, The Steiners returned to WCW in 1996, battling Harlem Heat and The Outsiders for the WCW Tag Team Titles. But as The New World Order’s power expanded, Scott Steiner saw an opportunity to achieve a higher level of success beyond the tag team division. During a Tag Team Title defense against The Outsiders at SuperBrawl VIII, Scott turned on his brother and joined The nWo.Although The Steiner Brothers split, Rick managed to defeat his brother and The Giant for the WCW Tag Team Championships despite his own partner, Buff Bagwell, betraying him. Later naming Kenny Kaos as his tag team partner, the duo successfully defended the titles until The Dog-Faced Gremlin was sidelined with an injury.Upon his return, the former Michigan Wolverine captured the WCW Television Title on three occasions as well as the United States Championship. For a brief period, he reunited with his brother, but their differences seemed irrevocable and they again went their separate ways.Although he never returned to WWE like his younger brother following the acquisition of WCW, Rick Steiner’s impact as a tag team competitor is immeasurable. His amateur background mixed with his tough-as-nails attitude made him a formidable opponent for anyone.

Learning his trade in small promotions across the country, the Hawaiian competitor made his first major impact in the Mid-Atlantic region. During his nearly eight-year run in the territory, The Dragon specialized in tag team competition, forming a dynamic and highly successful tandem with Jay Youngblood.In singles action, his most memorable confrontations took place against Ric Flair in an unforgettable rivalry in WCW in 1989.

Rikishi would then try his luck with a new partner, Sionne, but the pair had limited success. The Samoan then briefly competed in singles action, before leaving WWE in 1997.In 1999, Rikishi returned with a new name and a new look, consisting of bleached blonde hair, hip sunglasses and sumo wrestling gear. The big man formed a wildly popular alliance with the duo known as Too Cool, Grand Master Sexay and Scotty 2 Hotty. This trio was loved for their hip hop dance moves and for Rikishi\'s infamous signature maneuver — the Stink Face. When his opponent was incapacitated in the corner of the ring, Rikishi would stand over the Superstar and plant his ample buttocks on their face. This humiliating move was applied to many WWE greats, including Mr. McMahon and The Rock.  As a fan favorite, Rikishi had a memorable reign as Intercontinental Champion and waged great rivalries with Edge & Christian and Val Venis.In spite of this memorable run as a fun-loving big man, Rikishi may be best remembered as the driver of the car that hit \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin at the 1999 Survivor Series. Claiming he had performed this heinous act to allow his cousin, The Rock, to capture the WWE Championship, Rikishi began to battle Austin, culminating in a brutal No Holds Barred Match at No Mercy in 2000. Later, it was revealed that Triple H was the mastermind behind the hit and run, giving the WWE Universe more reason to detest the once-popular Samoan.Eventually, the bulky Superstar saw the error of his ways and went back to being a man the fans could cheer for.

A long war between her and Mero and Jacqueline (who became Mero\'s manager) ensued and that ultimately led to Sable winning the Women\'s Championship from her nemesis at the Survivor Series in 1998.Sable\'s popularity skyrocketed as she landed on the cover of mainstream magazines like TV Guide, but the weight of fame may have been too much for Sable to bear. WWE fans and Superstars soon noticed that she developed a massive ego. She began wearing Hollywood shades to the ring, and looked down on the people who loved her with scorn. In the ring, she mocked her opponents with \"the grind,\" a move reminiscent of \"Ravishing\" Rick Rude where she gyrated her hips. Sable also began to taunt the WWE Universe by saying, \"This is for all the women who want to be me and all the men who come to see me.\" Sable channeled her new attitude into a more aggressive in-ring style as she battled Luna Vachon and Debra before leaving WWE in 1999.In Sable\'s last WWE run in 2003 and 2004, she found new rivals in Torrie Wilson and Stephanie McMahon. She also served as a trusted confidante of Mr. McMahon in a war with Stephanie. But despite her evil tendencies, WWE fans loved to see Sable.Whether she is remembered as the Diva of WWE Divas or a magazine cover girl, one thing is certain: Sable was a pioneer who broke new ground for the ladies of the ring.

Whether he was tearing himself with barbed wire or flipping off the ropes through tables and chairs, each one of Sabu’s matches belonged on a “best of” DVD. The man who would come to be known as The Human Highlight Reel was as game-changing as they come.Though his persona was that of a Saudi madman, Sabu’s origins were far from hectic Arabian bazaars — he was from Michigan. Descending from a famed wrestling bloodline, Sabu was the nephew of The Sheik and was trained alongside future rival and partner Rob Van Dam by his barbaric, WWE Hall of Fame uncle. After cutting his teeth (and torso) in Japanese death matches, Sabu arrived in ECW.Briefly sojourning to WCW in late 1995, Sabu returned to his extreme roots, and competed in a series of epic bouts against RVD. The two aerial experts traded victories in mid-1996, but eventually earned each other’s respect and formed one of sports-entertainment’s hottest tag teams. Led by the whistle-blowing Bill Alfonso, the duo employed chairs, ring ropes and guardrails to execute stunning maneuvers and win championships. Their trailblazing bout against The Eliminators at Cyberslam 1997 paved the way for WWE’s Tables, Ladders and Chairs Matches.Tazz, an early rival of Sabu’s, also paired up with the hardcore high-flyer to win the ECW Tag Team Championship by defeating ECW’s top thugs, The Public Enemy. In the following years, the two extreme icons began to rise to superstardom in parallel with one another, and eventually became the company’s main attractions with the most fervent of fanbases. Once Sabu and Tazz both reached a zenith of notoriety, the Philadelphia faithful began clamoring for a match between them.After a full year of taunts, Sabu finally agreed to face Tazz in the most highly anticipated match in ECW history at the company’s first pay-per-view, Barely Legal. The man from the Red Hook section of Brooklyn, N.Y., emerged victorious, but Sabu turned the tables following the bout, stealing away Tazz’s manager, Bill Alfonso. The two innovators swapped wins in brutal rematches during the following three years, and Sabu even briefly captured Tazz’s personally created title before bringing the legendary rivalry to a close.Nearly 10 years after his first appearance, Sabu returned to Raw in preparation for WWE’s relaunch of the ECW brand. Finally being unleashed on WWE rings, Sabu competed in marquee contests over the following year with John Cena for the WWE Championship and Rey Mysterio for the World Heavyweight Championship. The pinnacle of Sabu\'s career came when he and fellow ECW Originals, Rob Van Dam. Tommy Dreamer and The Sandman defeated Matt Striker, Kevin Thorn, Marcus Cor Von and Elijah Burke at WrestleMania 23 at Ford Field in Detroit as more than 80,000 fans chanted \"E-C-DUB!\" Shortly thereafter, Sabu left WWE in May 2007 and is still putting his opponents through tables all over the world.Sabu never spoke. His actions did the talking. His remarkable appetite for competition was infectious. In one bout where the ring ropes were replaced with barbed wire, Sabu taped up his own arm mid-match after shredding his bicep. In others, he sealed a wound with superglue and reattached his jaw to his skull, all so Sabu could continue to inflict punishment. Grapplers and fans alike marveled everywhere at The Homicidal, Suicidal, Genocidal, Death-Defying Man Known the World over as Sabu.');

But Santino Marella is no stale cannoli. In fact, he made a career out of improbable moments that have been savored to the delight of the WWE Universe. He captured the attention of more than a few Divas (even before he shaved his unibrow), as well as his share of championships, both as an individual and a tag partner. He had the fastest elimination in 2009’s Royal Rumble (1.9 seconds in 2009) — a feat that only he could dare claim as a badge of honor. And if you think he’s the only successful Marella in his family, bear in mind that his “twin sister” Santina is a former “Miss WrestleMania.”Yes, Santino Marella’s time in WWE has been nothing if not unique — and certainly not without its share of success. In addition to his Intercontinental Title reign, Marella also laid claim to the United States Championship in March 2012. His championship run came to a crashing halt against Cesaro at The 25th Anniversary of SummerSlam, but the Italian rapscallion can still boast about having the eighth-longest reign since the title was reinstated by WWE in 2003.Following a stint on the shelf due to injury, Santino made a triumphant return to Raw on Sept. 9, 2013, defeating old foe Cesaro in a one-on-one bout that brought the crowd to its feet. However, The Italian Stallion’s momentum suffered a setback at WWE Battleground, where he and The Great Khali fell to The Real Americans in tag team action. As the calendar year changed, a leaner, (not really) meaner Santino emerged and formed an alliance with Emma, with whom the Italian Superstar seemed to be smitten. Santino took part in WrestleMania 30’s Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royale, but failed to outlast 29 other superstars and secure the Andre the Giant trophy.The WWE Universe knew full well that this lovable Italian was a gifted competitor and a true showman.

All-out brawls between the three mobs became routine on Raw before the groups quietly faded from WWE. Vega fought on as a singles competitor for a brief period of time — including an impressive beating of the bodybuilder Brakkus in the infamous full contact Brawl for All tournament — before parting ways with WWE in ’98.

Slaughter is an instantly recognizable American icon to WWE fans and general pop culture enthusiasts alike. A former U.S. Marine who proudly served his country, “Sarge” burst onto the wrestling scene in 1974 using his real name, Robert Remus in the American Wrestling Association (AWA), working for and trained by WWE Hall of Famer Verne Gagne.Four years later, Remus donned a mask as Super Destroyer Mark II, teaming with Super Destroyer Mark III managed by Lord Alfred Hayes. After a falling out with his partner, Super Destroyer Mark II took on WWE Hall of Famer, Bobby “The Brain” Heenan as his manager and began a series of ring wars with his former partner and Hayes.It was not until six years after his professional debut that Remus decided to incorporate his status as a United States Marine Corps veteran and debut in WWE in 1980 as the brutal bullying drill instructor, Sgt. Slaughter who referred to his outmatched opponents as scum, slime and maggots. In less than one year with WWE, Slaughter was doing battle with legends like Bruno Sammartino, Pedro Morales, Pat Patterson and even Andre The Giant.In 1981, Sgt Slaughter took his penchant for punishment to the NWA where he defeated Ricky “The Dragon” Steamboat for the United States Championship. Sarge also proved he could still dominate tag team wrestling as well, teaming with Don Kernoodle to become NWA World Tag Team Champions.Slaughter returned to WWE in 1983 and, still reviled by its fans, instantly main-evented against WWE Champion Bob Backlund but was unable to take the title from the All-American standard bearer. Almost a decade after his professional debut, Sgt. Slaughter had still not attained every competitor’s dream of being a World Champion.In 1984, Sgt. Slaughter had heard enough of anti-America rhetoric from for WWE Champion, The Iron Sheik and decided to defend the honor of his country, instantly making him a fan favorite with the WWE Universe. For an entire year, Sgt. Slaughter battled The Iron Sheik in almost all of the 50 states in bloody Steel Cage Matches and Boot Camp Matches. Sgt. Slaughter finally silenced the Iranian aggressor and was second only to Hulk Hogan in terms of popularity with the WWE Universe. However, Slaughter was about to leave WWE right before the birth of WrestleMania in 1985 because of a dispute over action figures. Toy company Hasbro approached Sgt. Slaughter about becoming a character in their G.I. Joe franchise which included action figures. However, at the time, WWE had an exclusive agreement with rival toy company LJN, Sarge had to choose between WWE and G.I. Joe and chose to battle Cobra Commander and his evil forces as an action figure, a comic book hero and even on the G.I. Joe animated series.In order to continue his wildly successful wrestling career while being G.I. Joe’s best selling action figure, Slaughter returned to the promotion where he began his career, Verne Gagne’s AWA where he defended America ideals against the Soviet Union’s Boris Zhukov and South Africa’s Colonel DeBeers and even The Iron Sheik who followed Sarge to the AWA looking for vengeance. While all of his opponents had the advantage of having Sheik Adnan Al-Kaissey in their corner, Slaughter delighted wrestling fans by besting his opponents in bloody Boot Camp Matches. Sarge earned AWA World Title matches against Stan Hansen and then against Larry Zbyszko on ESPN but was still unable to win his first World Title.In 1990 the AWA’s demise was imminent and Sgt. Slaughter returned to WWE and was part of one of the most infamous chapters in WWE history. Slaughter claimed America had gone soft as a result of the end of the Cold War with the Soviet Union and did the unthinkable by becoming an Iraqi sympathizer during the Gulf War. Despite the distractions of death threats with enraged Americans, Slaughter finally won his first and only World Title when he defeated The Ultimate Warrior at Royal Rumble 1991 with the help of “Macho King” Randy Savage. At WrestleMania VII, Slaughter was defeated for The WWE Championship by the red, white and blue clad Hulk Hogan. Slaughter then found a way to sink even lower than he had by flanking himself with fellow Iraqi sympathizers General Adnan (formerly known as his nemesis, Sheik Adnan Al-Kaissey) and Colonel Mustafa (formerly known his most despised opponent, The Iron Sheik). At SummerSlam 1991, Hulk Hogan and The Ultimate Warrior defeated the trio now known as The Triangle of Terror, Sgt. Slaughter, General Adnan and Colonel Mustafa.After The United States soundly defeated Iraq in the Gulf War and months of soul searching, Sgt. Slaughter pleaded with the WWE Universe to accept his apology and welcome him back as a champion for the American way pleading “I want my country back.” Cautiously, WWE fans gave Sarge a chance to prove himself and he did, teaming with the American flag waving “Hacksaw” Jim Duggan to take on all aggressors, foreign and domestic. Almost two decades after his professional debut, Sgt. Slaughter retired from full time competition in 1992 and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by former foe turned long time friend, Pat Patterson in 2004.In 1997, Slaughter returned as WWE Commissioner and did his best to control the chaos created by newly formed D-Generation X, Triple H, Shawn Michaels and Chyna. After a stint as one of Mr. McMahon’s evil lackeys in his war against “Stone Cold” Steve Austin, Slaughter largely disappeared from television and assumed a behind the scenes role with World Wrestling Entertainment. The beloved Sarge is now an Ambassador for WWE and busy as ever appearing at charity events all over America and as the only legend who is part The National Guard’s WWE “Big Guns” Team alongside the likes of John Cena, Beth Phoenix and others . Sgt. Slaughter remains one of the most recognizable WWE personalities of all time and recently appeared on Comedy Central’s top rated program Tosh.0, NBC’s Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and most importantly, WWE’s annual Tribute to the Troops.Looking as fit as he did when he first laced up his boots in 1974, Sgt.

Dispatching his hardcore opponents with a rough, technical style — Douglas always favored belly to belly suplexes over barbwire bats — the Pittsburgh native became the first champion of the rebranded Extreme Championship Wrestling, and the leader of The Triple Threat. An obvious challenge to his nemesis Ric Flair and his Four Horsemen, the group’s rotating cast of characters included Bam Bam Bigelow, Chris Candido and “Primetime” Brian Lee at different times.A brief trip to WWE in ’95 became the career lowlight for Douglas as the Dean Douglas persona (based on the fact that he was formerly a school teacher) forced upon him failed to catch on with WWE fans who saw it as a retread of The Genius. When he returned to ECW, he had an even bigger chip on his shoulder. Now with his “head cheerleader” Francine by his side, The Franchise captured both the ECW Television and ECW World Heavyweight Titles while besting Chris Jericho, Bam Bam Bigelow, Sabu and many more.After losing the ECW World Heavyweight Title to Tazz at the Guilty as Charged pay-per-view in 1999, Douglas returned to WCW for a strong two-year run as The Franchise. He won both the United States Title and the WCW Tag Team Titles (alongside Buff Bagwell) and captained competitors like Dean Malenko and Perry Saturn in an impressive faction known as Revolution.The Franchise disappeared from the national scene following the closure of WCW in 2001, but he continues to be an outspoken presence on the independent scene. To anyone who has a problem with that, Douglas’ message remains as explicit as it was on the night of Aug. 27, 1994: “They can all kiss my @$$!”');

In fact, Shane was the play-by-play man on the debut edition of Sunday Night Heat in 1999.It wasn’t until the younger McMahon stepped out from behind the microphone that the WWE Universe saw how similar to his father he was, yet different in many ways. There’s no doubt that Shane McMahon inherited his father’s entrepreneurial spirit. However, he put a modern twist on it. He eschewed a suit and tie for a more casual look, not unlike contemporary moguls like Mark Cuban. His flamboyant, cocky attitude could be both endearing and irritating.Perhaps Shane’s crowning moment as a businessman came on March 26, 2001. His father believed he had purchased long-time rival WCW, ending the \"Monday Night War\" that raged throughout the 1990s. However, Mr. McMahon’s desire to embarrass his former competition gave Shane the opportunity of a lifetime. While his father showboated over his supposed conquest, Shane shocked the world when he appeared in person at the final Monday Nitro to announce that the name on the purchase papers did say McMahon — Shane McMahon.Shane’s devil-may-care attitude carried over from the boardroom into the ring. Most heirs to a billion-dollar company wouldn’t dare risk life and limb in-between the ropes. Shane-O-Mac went above and beyond the call of duty. He surprised the WWE Universe with his athletic ability and willingness to climb, literally, to new heights and take a leap of faith, crashing onto his opponents below. During his in-ring career, McMahon toppled the gigantic Big Show, stood toe-to-toe with Olympic gold medalist Kurt Angle and even defeated his father in a brutal Street Fight at WrestleMania X-Seven.After leaving WWE to pursue other opportunities in 2010, Shane McMahon return on the Feb. 22, 2016 edition of Raw. Surprising the world, he boldly challenged his father and sister for control of WWE\'s flagship program. He may have come up short in his Hell in a Cell Match against The Undertaker at WrestleMania 32, but his thrilling leap off the top of the structure embodied the tenacity and fearlessness of sports-entertainment’s first family. ');

After charming crowds as a Rocker in the ’90s, HBK infamously severed his partnership with Marty Jannetty by smashing his friend’s head through a window.

Instead, it only added to the allure of one of sports-entertainment’s most captivatingly flawed figures. A rebel in leather chaps, Michaels bucked authority and surrounded himself with people who did the same. As the troublemaker behind DX, HBK made life a living hell for the McMahon family alongside his longtime running buddy Triple H. As a member of The Kliq, he did the same for the WWE locker room, carefully wielding his considerable influence to get the best treatment for himself and friends like Kevin Nash and Scott Hall.The self-proclaimed “Sexy Boy” could be an unrepentant primadonna, but he was so fluid and brilliant in the ring that it hardly mattered. His Ladder Match with Razor Ramon at WrestleMania X established his reputation for having the best bout on The Grandest Stage of Them All — a tradition he’d continue in classics against Kurt Angle, Chris Jericho and The Undertaker.HBK’s thrilling run was nearly brought to an early end when a back injury put him out for more than four years. In that time, he fell in love, had children, found religion. When he finally returned, Michaels displayed none of the flaws that plague many Superstars in their final years in the ring. Instead, The Icon continued to have career-defining matches right up until his last stand against The Phenom at WrestleMania XXVI. Although it was one of the final times WWE fans would hear the crack of Sweet Chin Music, audiences did not mourn HBK’s retirement.

That summer, however, Slick and Reed were on the short end of a Loser Leaves Town Match against the legendary Bruiser Brody, leaving the \"Doctor of Style\" without a home only months after his debut.But you can\'t keep the Slickster down for long.Late in 1986, Slick entered WWE as a protégé of Hall of Famer \"Classy\" Freddie Blassie. Looking to diversify his holdings, Blassie sold half interest in his stable of Superstars to the \"Doctor of Style,\" giving Slick co-managerial rights to such greats as Nikolai Volkoff, The Iron Sheik and Hercules. After fully taking over Blassie\'s responsibilities in 1987, Slick also brought Reed into WWE as one of his clients.Once out on his own, Slick was known for two things: His impeccable dress code and using his cane as a weapon to help his charges win matches. Unfortunately for the \"Doctor of Style,\" those two worlds collided at WrestleMania III. Following Reed\'s win over Koko B. Ware, Slick and \"The Natural\" engaged in some chicanery with the cane; Tito Santana, a frequent victim of Slick\'s attacks, rushed the ring and literally tore the clothes off Slick\'s back, leaving his spiffy suit a tattered mess. Not one to admit defeat, however, the Slickster came out with Nikolai Volkoff & Iron Sheik later in the night still wearing that torn-apart suit.During his first four-year stint in WWE, Slick also managed the Twin Towers -- Akeem & Big Boss Man -- as well as Rick Martel and Warlord, among others.

Having become an ordained minister during his time away from WWE, he returned as Reverend Slick and was often seen delivering uplifting, positive sermons. Our fans quickly took to the \"new\" Slick, and his transformation into a full-fledged fan favorite became complete in 1993 when he \"saved\" Ugandan savage Kamala from manager Harvey Wippleman and handler Kim Chee. The Slickster took over as Kamala\'s manager, teaching the former savage how to be a bit more civilized, and our fans began to cheer the Ugandan Giant as well. Unfortunately, Slick left WWE for good soon after.These days, he still pops up at ringside from time to time -- most notably at WrestleMania 23, where he joined in a locker room dance party -- but spends most of his time working as a minister in his native Texas, a profession perfectly suited to a great orator such as himself. You can read more about Slick\'s current doings in WWE.com\'s \"Where Are They Now?\"With his smooth talking, flashy outfits and respected managerial prowess, Slick was certainly one of the pre-eminent managers of his time.

On that night, Blackman hopped over the guardrail to defend an outnumbered Vader against Canadian baddies Jim Neidhart, Doug Furnas and Phil Lafon. His focused dissection of three tough Superstars immediately established Blackman as a seriously dangerous individual.The stoic martial artist showed WWE fans just how tough he was in the years that followed as he brutalized Marc Mero in a full contact Brawl for All fight, punished Ken Shamrock in a series of vicious contests and brought legitimacy back to the Hardcore Title when he beat Crash Holly for the championship in 2000. A six-time holder of the no rules title, Blackman dispatched rough customers like Raven and Saturn with his calculated strikes and Filipino fighting sticks.Stakes weren’t always so high during Blackman’s career. He proved he could be lighthearted in his brief partnership with the unpredictable Al Snow as the mismatched Head Cheese. The polar opposites entertained the WWE Universe with their constant bickering, but The Lethal Weapon was always at his best when the time for talk was over. Blackman parted ways with WWE in October 2002.Blackman returned to WWE for a single night on the Raw 15th Anniversary Special on December 10, 2007, taking part in a legends battle royal.');

It was under the guise of “Big Stevie Cool” that Richards created an nWo parody known as The Blue World Order along with The Blue Meanie’s “Da Blue Guy” and “Hollywood” Nova. The group became an unexpected favorite of the hardcore ECW faithful, and the bWo T-shirt became the best-selling in the promotion\'s history.However, Stevie’s career wasn’t all jokes. The master of the Stevie Kick suffered a broken neck when WWE Hall of Famer Terry Funk dropped a steel guardrail on top of Richards in 1997 at the end of his five-year ECW tenure. Stevie underwent a neck fusion surgery that left him unable to speak, leading to more surgeries to regain the raspy voice he still has today.

It was that distinction that made him the backbone of the Atlanta-based organization throughout the late 1980s until the end of WCW in 2001.Beginning with his NWA debut in 1987, Sting brought an enormous amount of charisma to the ring with his bleach-blond hair, colorful face paint and neon ring gear. However, at the inaugural Clash of the Champions, a 45-minute time limit draw against NWA World Champion Ric Flair proved The Stinger was on his way to becoming one of sports-entertainment’s elite. Eventually, Sting defeated Flair for the NWA Title, and would later add six WCW World Titles, three WCW Tag Team Championships, two WCW International World Titles and two United States Championships to his resume throughout his career.While the charismatic competitor was wildly popular with WCW fans, it was a shocking transformation in 1996 that made Sting even more memorable. With The New World Order imposing their will over WCW, The Stinger adopted a darker personality with white and black face paint and attire. He became a silent warrior who lurked in the rafters of arenas all over the country, ready to strike The nWo at a moment’s notice. For more than a year, Sting never spoke or competed in the ring, captivating audiences until finally he squared off and defeated WCW Champion and nWo leader, “Hollywood” Hulk Hogan.Sting escalated his efforts against The nWo by joining longtime friend Lex Luger as part of The nWo Wolfpac, changing his white visage to red. However, when The nWo began to disband for good, Sting retained his dark look, but adopted an attitude more in line with his flashy \"surfer\" days.As WCW’s days became numbered, Sting remained loyal to the organization, engaging in memorable rivalries with Bret “Hit Man” Hart and Vampiro. Fittingly, Sting and Ric Flair squared off in the final match on the last episode of WCW Monday Nitro.Remembered for his colorful charisma and struggle with The nWo, Sting has become synonymous with the Atlanta-based organization. Although he had never competed in a WWE ring, more than a decade since the demise of WCW, he remained one of the most popular and respected competitors of all-time.At Survivor Series 2014, The Authority was pulling out all the stops to prevent Dolph Ziggler from defeating Seth Rollins in the Traditional Survivor Series Elimination Tag Team Match. When it appeared that Rollins would secure the victory for Team Authority and ensure they remain in power, Sting appeared for the first time in a WWE ring and confronted Triple H.Following a tense staredown, The Game attacked The Stinger, who countered by executing his patented Scorpion Death Drop. Sting then pulled Ziggler on top of Rollins, giving Team Cena the win and dethroning The Authority.As 2014 ended, John Cena was forced to bring The Authority back to power. One of their first orders of business was to fire Dolph Ziggler, Erick Rowan and Ryback for aiding Cena at Survivor Series. One week before the Royal Rumble pay-per-view, Cena battled Kane, Seth Rollins and Big Show in a 3-on-1 Handicap Match in an effort to save his allies\' jobs. Although the odds were stacked against the Cenation leader, Sting returned again– making his WWE Raw debut – distracting Rollins and allowing Cena to capture a pinfall victory.Fed up with Sting\'s interference, Triple H called out The Stinger for a face-to-face confrontation at WWE Fastlane. Using mind games of his own to frighten The Cerebral Assassin with a number of dopplegangers, WCW\'s face-painted franchise accepted The Game\'s offer.At WWE Fastlane, Triple H attacked Sting, but The Vigilante evened the odds with his legendary baseball bat. Pointing to the WrestleMania sign hanging above the ring, Sting challenged The Game to a battle on The Grandest Stage of Them All.Sting made a surprise appearance on the March 16 edition of Raw, coming to the aid of Randy Orton and standing tall with The Viper over The Authority\'s forces. The Vigilante made his presence felt, sending a message to Triple H in the process before their epic confrontation at WrestleMania 31. The following week, The Icon kicked off Monday Night Raw for the first time ever only to be interrupted by both Stephanie McMahon and Triple H, coming face to face with his WrestleMania opponent just six days before their clash on The Grandest Stage of Them All.Setting foot inside a WWE ring to compete for the first time at WrestleMania 31, Sting nearly defeated Triple H on several occasions. However, when he locked in his patented Scoprion Death Lock, The Game\'s DX cronies made their way to the ring to try and take The Stinger out. Surviving the inital onslaught, Sting nearly met Triple H\'s sledgehammer before The nWo made their way to the ring to take out DX. As the chaos between the WWE and WCW factions erupted, Sting regained control of the match. However, Triple H managed to get his sledgehammer and knock Sting out before The Vigilante could capitalize on a second Stinger Splash. Although The Game and WWE stood victorious in the final battle against WCW, WWE\'s COO showed his respect by shaking Sting\'s hand after the match.It would be Triple H\'s protege, Seth Rollins, who would next face off against the face-painted legend at Night of Champions. The two would battle for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship with Rollins squeaking by with a roll up on The Stinger.Though The Stinger often likes to say \"the only thing sure about Sting is that nothing is for sure,\" there is one thing nobody can deny - that Sting has had a Hall of Fame-worthy career.

Clad in jeans and black leather often soaked in beer foam, Austin was defiant, brash and dared anyone to try and tell him what to do. When the signature sound of shattering glass erupted throughout the arena, everyone there knew that it was time to raise hell. And if you happened to be on the receiving end, well, you have our sympathies.Trained by \"Gentleman\" Chris Adams, Steve Austin broke into the wrestling business in Texas in 1990, as part of the USWA. After a year he moved on to WCW, where he won the WCW Television Championship under the name \"Stunning\" Steve Austin. An elbow injury lead to his firing from WCW, but Austin found a lifeboat in ECW, and, with the freedom afforded him by Paul Heyman, began crafting a voice that would later lead to superstardom in WWE.Austin joined WWE in January 1996 as Ted DiBiase\'s \"Million Dollar Champion.\" Debuting as \"The Ringmaster,\" he defeated Savio Vega in a forgettable WrestleMania contest. Soon after, \"Stone Cold\" was born.In June 1996, The Texas Rattlesnake became King of the Ring, defeating Jake Roberts in the tournament final. To cap off the victory, \"Stone Cold\" delivered a riveting promo, pillorying Roberts and his religious beliefs, and heralding the birth of the “Austin 3:16” era. His words gave way to Austin\'s WWE destiny, ushering in the famed Attitude Era. This violent Superstar would stop at nothing until he reached WWE’s top tier, and pummel anyone who dared cross his path.The first Superstar to but heads with the new, meaner Austin was Bret Hart. Their rivalry reached its apex at WrestleMania 13, in a Submission Match. Austin was not the technical wunderkind that Hart was, but matched the mat general strike for strike in front of the Rosemont crowd. But the moment that separated Austin from his peers in the locker room came at the matches end. \"Stone Cold\" was nearly broken, trapped in Hart’s Sharpshooter. But he refused to break the hold, and as seconds ticked into minutes, he still would not tap. Referee Ken Shamrock called the match as Austin passed out from the pain, with 18,000 people cheering the defeated Superstar.But Austin’s momentum, and WWE career, nearly halted in a freak injury at 1997’s SummerSlam. During a match against Owen Hart, Austin was dropped on his head during a piledriver from Hart, fracturing his neck.\"Stone Cold\" ultimately recovered from the injury, and soon began his torrid rise to the top of the WWE heap. Austin’s matches against Superstars such as Bret Hart, Shawn Michaels and the Undertaker, but he’s best remembered for his battles against two men — The Rock, and the WWE Chairman himself, Mr. McMahon.The latter rivalry began in late 1997, when Austin, furious at McMahon for stripping him of the Intercontinental Title, delivered a \"Stone Cold\" Stunner to his boss in front of the Madison Square Garden crowd. It wouldn’t be the first time Mr. McMahon tasted Austin’s leather boot, as the pair’s hostile feud epitomized the Attitude Era.The Rock and Austin criss-crossed just as often as Austin and Mr. McMahon. To put the rivalry in perspective, \"Stone Cold\" and the Rock, together, headlined three WrestleMania pay-per-views from 1993 to 2003, a feat no other Superstar has ever even come close to accomplishing. The two stars couldn’t have been more different, but no two men were ever as popular at the same time as Austin and Rock.Austin retired from in-ring competition at the end of WrestleMania XIX, but continued to make memorable WWE appearances, usually at the expense of the McMahon. WWE crowds were never as long as when that glass shattered, and \"Stone Cold\" made his way to the ring, either in his leather boots, a Zamboni, or a beer truck.At the end, his in-ring accomplishments were many: six WWE Championships, two Intercontinental Championships, a record three Royal Rumble victories and Triple Crown Champion credentials. His 2009 induction to the WWE Hall of Fame was a “no-brainer.”');

This destitute lifestyle often led him to the local YMCA where he discovered amateur wrestling. His introduction to the sport was rigorous as he was brutalized by much older boys on a daily basis — a memory he would carry with him for the rest of his life. But as he grew, so did his talents, and by the 1940s he had played for the Canadian Football League and won multiple amateur wrestling championships. Unfortunately, the cancellation of the Olympics during the Second World War dashed Stu\'s childhood dream of winning a gold medal. With the Olympics no longer an option, Stu headed to New York City in hopes of becoming a professional wrestler. Immediately, his impressive build, rugged good looks and extensive amateur background caught the attention of noted promoter Toots Mondt. Mondt, one of the forefathers of WWE, saw potential in the strapping Canadian and took him under his wing. While never a champion, Stu had many high-profile matches with ring legends like Lou Thesz and Frank Sexton and developed a well-deserved reputation as a legitimate tough guy.It was during this time that Stu met Helen Smith, a shy girl with a thick New York accent who would become his wife for the next 53 years. While Helen did not share Stu\'s love of wrestling, their children certainly did. The Hart\'s eight sons — Bret, Owen, Ross, Dean, Wayne, Keith, Bruce and Smith — all worked in the wrestling industry. Their daughters — Diana, Alison, Georgia and Ellie — all married wrestlers.The Harts raised their kids in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. It was here that Stu established Stampede Wrestling, a regional promotion which ran shows throughout western Canada for nearly 40 years. Home to local stars like Gama Singh and The Stomper as well as international standouts like Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts and Abdullah the Butcher, Stampede was very much a family business. Stu and his boys were the stars, Wayne reffed the matches, Helen handled the bookkeeping.Due to the up-and-down nature of the wrestling business, there were many lean years for the family, but business could be very good. In 1951, during a boom period, Stu purchased an expansive mansion in Calgary that would become known as The Hart House. A massive, redbrick manor that was once an orphanage, the house was a bustling center of activity. Children ran through the hallways, visiting wrestlers slept in guest rooms and a bear named Ted lived under the back porch. But it was in the basement where the true madness happened.Known as \"The Dungeon,\" Stu Hart\'s makeshift gym has become the stuff of wrestling lore. Little more than some old, thin mats surrounded by cracked wood paneling and rusted barbells, \"The Dungeon\" was the rigorous training ground of future ring legends like \"Superstar\" Billy Graham, Brian Pillman and The British Bulldogs. A strict mentor, the barrel-chested Stu delighted in twisting his students to their physical limits — a skill he had learned decades earlier in the dingy gyms of Saskatoon.This act, known as \"stretching,\" could bring even the toughest man to tears. Stu\'s children have often spoken about watching bodybuilders or professional football players walk down the narrow stairwell to \"The Dungeon\" and then hearing their screams of pain rising through the floorboards minutes later.Stu also subjected his sons to this harsh style of training. While this strict schooling was difficult for the boys when they were younger, it paid off in the long run. Due in part to their father\'s guidance, Bret \"Hit Man\" Hart and Owen Hart would achieve international stardom, becoming two of the most beloved competitors in WWE history. Stu was on hand for many of their greatest accomplishments, including Bret\'s Intercontinental Championship win at SummerSlam \'91 in Madison Square Garden and Survivor Series 1993 where Bret, Owen, Keith and Bruce teamed successfully.While Hart wrestled only sporadically after the \'70s, he continued to train young grapplers well into his 80s. Even with arthritis and diabetes crippling his once mighty body, Stu could still bring the biggest man to his breaking point. When his health worsened, his sons took over the majority of the family operations, giving younger competitors like Chris Jericho, Lance Storm and The Hart Dynasty the ability to experience the Hart-style of training.Stewart Edward Hart passed away on Oct. 16, 2003 at the age of 88. While his death was attributed to a stroke, the tough, old Canadian was said to be the victim of a broken heart, having never truly gotten over the loss of his beloved wife two years earlier. His funeral was attended by hundreds of friends, family and admirers, including many of the countless competitors he inspired like Jericho, Jim \"The Anvil\" Neidhart and Bad News Brown.Stu Hart\'s respect extended beyond the ring, as well. The Hart House, a part of wrestling history as significant as Madison Square Garden, has become a historic landmark in Canada. And in 2000, Stu was awarded the Order of Canada — the country\'s highest honor.His posthumous induction into the class of 2010 is yet another testament to not only an amazing career, but an extraordinary life. ');

But the beauty never planned on entering the squared circle. As a teenager in New Jersey, she was a stellar student who was set to attend the University of Miami on a full academic scholarship. Then she met a kid named Chris Candido and her life was forever changed.An aspiring Superstar, Candido persuaded Sytch to turn down her scholarship and follow him to Tennessee where he was set to begin work with Jim Cornette\'s Smoky Mountain Wrestling. She went along and started classes at the University of Tennessee, but she was soon convinced by Cornette to start working for SMW as an abrasive, self-styled manager who idolized Hillary Clinton. Sytch agreed and proved to be a natural villain, striking a chord with the audience to the point that fans would leap over the railings to attack her during shows.This rare mix of beauty and business smarts soon caught the attention of WWE, leading to Sytch signing a contract in 1995. First working as a broadcast correspondent, she soon returned to managing Candido. Now known as The Bodydonnas, the couple became Sunny and Skip, a pair of smug fitness freaks who delighted in insulting the physiques of everyone in the WWE Universe. Soon joined by Skip\'s \"brother\" Zip, the team won the World Tag Team Championships at WrestleMania XII in 1996.That same year, Sunny\'s popularity exploded. Her bikini issue of RAW Magazine sold a record number of copies, she won two Slammy Awards (including Best Buns) and was deemed the most downloaded woman in the world by America Online. Suddenly, the loathed villain was one of the hottest personalities in WWE.More ring success followed.

And in 1998 she experienced the biggest thrill of her managerial career when he she accompanied a reenergized Legion of Doom, Hawk and Animal, to the ring at WrestleMania XIV.Sunny’s stint with L.O.D. 2000 proved to be her last major run in WWE. She went on to Extreme Championship Wrestling and World Championship Wrestling. Sytch will forever be remembered as the person who redefined the role of women in WWE. She wasn\'t just a brainless bikini model or a vivacious valet at ringside. She was a pinup, a fast-talking manager and could throw down when she needed to. In short, she was sexy, smart and powerful. The claim may be a topic of debate, but Sytch will always defend her belief that she is the original WWE Diva.“My definition of a Diva is that all-around, well-rounded performer,\" she told WWE.com. “The girls who came before me were so one dimensional and then I came along and anything they threw at me I could do. I could get in the ring and have a match, I managed at ringside, I co-hosted TV shows, I did broadcasting. I was the first one to do it all.\"Statements like this have made Sunny the target of controversy, but it is not something she shies away from.

Never before had three competitors formed a tag team, thus when they won the NWA National Tag Team Titles in Georgia Championship Wrestling, “The Freebird Rule” was established. Under this stipulation, any two man combination of the group’s members could defend the tag team championships, not just the duo that won them.After a string of successes in Georgia, The Freebirds moonwalked their way into the Texas-based World Class Championship Wrestling and embarked on a legendary rivalry with the revered Von Erich family. During this time, the group’s leader, Michael Hayes, recorded a song entitled “Badstreet, U.S.A.” that The Freebirds used as an entrance theme. Although they originally entered the ring to Lynyrd Skynyrd’s aptly titled “Freebird,” Hayes’ new track would pioneer the use of individual and original entrance themes for competitors.The Freebirds became a force to be reckoned with in WCCW. They were brutal in their tactics and also in their attitudes toward their opponents. It was those attitudes that helped them win the Six-Man Tag Team Titles six times and the NWA American Tag Team Titles. Roberts also became WCCW Television Champion and Gordy held the NWA American Heavyweight Title. And it was during this time that The Freebirds added a fourth member, Jimmy “Jam” Garvin who would become Hayes’ frequent tag team partner.Upon leaving WCCW, The Freebirds briefly joined WWE as part of Cyndi Lauper’s Rock ‘n’ Wrestling Connection. Their tenure was short-lived and they competed in the AWA, followed by UWF (rechristened Mid-South Wrestling), where their tag team success continued, twice capturing the titles.

Formed during an impromptu interview in January of 1986, The Four Horsemen mixed style and subterfuge to craft the blueprint for team warfare that every future faction would follow.  Showcasing professional wrestling’s elite over the next 15 years, the group counts Dean Malenko, Curt Hennig and Sid amongst its storied alumni, but their best incarnation comprised five men — Ric Flair, Arn Anderson, Tully Blanchard, Barry Windham and JJ Dillon.This crew came together in the spring of 1988 when the preternaturally talented Windham turned his back on longtime friend Lex Luger to ride with The Horsemen. The young Texan was a perfect fit. The type of competitor who inspired hyperbole in his peers, the 6-foot-7 Windham had more God-given talent than any man deserves — and the United States Championship. When he joined The Four Horsemen’s ranks, it gave the unit control of every major title in NWA as Flair carried the World Championship and Arn and Tully toted the tag titles.With that, the group redefined sports-entertainment. They donned Armani suits when other wrestlers were rocking Zubaz and fanny packs. They hopped into private jets while everyone else in the locker room crammed into cheap rental cars. They were first-class all the way, but it never made them soft. Double A’s spinebuster was so whip-fast and devastating, you had to believe chiropractors sent him Christmas cards. Blanchard was the consummate technician with the mean streak of a prison warden, while Dillon would do whatever it took to get the win for his side. And who was tougher than The “Nature Boy?” The 16-time World Champion was internationally known for going the distance with hard hitters every night of the week and twice on Sunday. With Slick Ric leading the way, these studs had little trouble backing up their claims of being the best in the business.They cemented this reputation at The Great American Bash in 1988, when Anderson, Blanchard, Windham and Flair all walked out of the Baltimore Arena with their titles still in hand, overcoming serious opponents like Dusty Rhodes and Sting in the process. Still, no matter what happened, they’d always show up the next day with designer sunglasses covering their black eyes and boast about their greatness.Anderson and Blanchard’s defection to WWE at the end of ’88 brought an early end to these Horsemen, but it hardly affected their place in history. Later incarnations of the team would measure their success against this squad, while future factions like Evolution and Legacy cited them as their greatest inspiration.

The other maneuvers in his arsenal — namely the moonsault and cartwheel back elbow — were every bit as breathtaking.Muta found his ultimate North American rival in Sting.

The smash-mouth style of Knobbs and Sags, combined with the high-flying panache of Michaels and Jannetty resulted in a series of unique matchups that solidified each duo as forces to be reckoned in any tag team division.After The Nasty Boys were unable to capture the AWA Tag Team Titles from The Midnight Rockers, they landed in Eddie Graham’s hallowed Championship Wrestling from Florida.

Only six weeks after their debut, The Nasty Boys outlasted legendary pairs like Legion of Doom, Demolition and their old rivals The Rockers to win a Tag Team Battle Royal on an edition of Superstars.

Using everything from the stench of their armpits to garbage cans, Knobbs and Sags knocked out their opponents during their three reigns as WCW Tag Team Champions. When Sags retired from in-ring competition, Knobbs became a natural fit in WCW’s Hardcore Division and won the WCW Hardcore Title on three occasions, a record for that championship.Over the course of a 15-year ring career, the two tough degenerates crushed skulls in squared circles around the country.

Heyman noticed Cheetah’s tremendous chemistry against a grappler named Johnny Rotten, and decided that if the two were such great opponents, they must make a great tag team. The Public Enemy was born.Rotten changed his last name to Grunge and The Cheetah Kid was reborn as “Flyboy” Rocco Rock. Together, the tandem opened UltraClash on Sept. 18, 1993 — Heyman’s first show in charge of ECW — and The Public Enemy became an instant Philadelphia sensation.

With their fun-loving demeanor and reckless disregard in the ring, “Flyboy” and Grunge’s popularity began to skyrocket, leading them to four reigns as ECW Tag Team Champions by defeating competitors including Tazz, Cactus Jack, Mikey Whipwreck and Dean Malenko.They were so popular that after one victory over The Gangstas, the tandem was joined in the ring by nearly the entire crowd of ECW faithful in attendance.

The following year, he dropped the “Mr.” from his name and began carrying around a Singapore cane, which became symbolic of The Sandman\'s persona for the rest of his career. As part of the organization\'s rebirth as Extreme Championship Wrestling, The Sandman engaged in a bitter rivalry with Tommy Dreamer that resulted in the cane-swinging competitor being blinded in the eye by a lit cigarette.In April 1995, The Sandman won his second ECW Championship by defeating fellow Extreme pioneer Shane Douglas. The brawler had a series of brutal matches throughout the year with Cactus Jack before losing the title to Mikey Whipwreck in October.

Truthfully, ECW only brought it back to the forefront, as throughout his near 50-year career, The Sheik pioneered, revolutionized and made popular his hardcore style. No object was too foreign and no tactic was too underhanded for The Sheik, who counted sharpened pencils and flying fireballs as some of his best offensive weapons. He would finish his opponents with the dreaded Camel Clutch, a hold that was later also used by another Hall of Famer, The Iron Sheik, as well as Farhat\'s own nephew, Sabu.Underneath that exterior, however, Farhat had the athletic ability to back up his unique skill set. He was a star high school football player in Michigan, going on to play for the University of Michigan. After serving in the United States Army during World War II, Farhat began his career in sports-entertainment, making light of his Lebanese heritage and rechristening himself as The Sheik. This was the beginning of a journey that would see him cross paths with numerous Hall of Famers over the next half-century.The Sheik spent a good portion of his career in the Midwest, making his biggest fame in his home state of Michigan. His brutal rivalry with fellow Hall of Famer Bobo Brazil lasted for over three decades, becoming one of the most legendary rivalries in sports-entertainment history. The Sheik also had another historic rivalry with Freddie Blassie, as the two men bled buckets all over Los Angeles in a rivalry that included numerous Steel Cage Matches. In addition to his in-ring work, Sheik was the main promoter of Detroit\'s Big Time Wrestling in the 1960s and 1970sWhile away from Detroit, Sheik had two stints in WWE during the 1960s. In his first run, Sheik and partner Johnny Valentine had a memorable rivalry with Antonino Rocca & Miguel Perez. Later in the 1960s, Sheik returned to begin a heated rivalry with WWE Champion Bruno Sammartino, but despite several attempts in front of several sellout crowds, he was never able to wrest the gold from the popular champion.Sheik also spent time in Japan and Canada, where he was undefeated for 127 straight matches in Toronto\'s Maple Leaf Gardens; several Hall of Famers were victims of The Sheik during this streak, until it was ended in 1974 by the legendary Andre the Giant. In Japan, Sheik both fought and teamed with fellow extreme icon Abdullah the Butcher; the two were a lethal combination when together, engaging in a bloody and memorable war with Terry & Dory Funk in the late 1970s.In the 1980s and early 1990s, Sheik returned to his home state of Michigan, content to pass on his hardcore legacy by training several future Superstars. Among them were nephew Sabu and Rob Van Dam, as well as the son of his former partner, WWE Hall of Famer Greg \"The Hammer\" Valentine, and fellow U of M alum Scott Steiner. Sabu patterned his in-ring style heavily after that of his uncle, and he and Van Dam were two of the cornerstone talents that brought ECW and the extreme style into the limelight.The Sheik still continued wrestling occasionally as well, even spending some time in ECW himself. Along with Pat Tanaka, The Sheik had some classic matches in 1994 with Kevin Sullivan and Tazz, who would later become one of his nephew\'s biggest rivals. Finally, in 1998, The Sheik hung up the boots after nearly 50 years in the ring, wrestling his last match in Japan at the age of 74.Throughout his career, he was just as silent as he was dangerous. The Sheik never spoke, instead letting his managers (which included fellow Hall of Famer The Grand Wizard) do all of his talking. Sadly, while in the midst of writing his autobiography, Farhat passed away in 2003. When he was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2007 by Sabu and Van Dam, Farhat\'s plaque was received by his wife, Joyce.The Sheik was extreme before most fans knew what that term truly meant, and the reckless, rule-breaking style he pioneered will forever be a part of the evolution of sports-entertainment.

Johnny followed soon after in 1967, and together they won several regional tag team championships. The Valiants entered WWE in the early 1970s, and at times they seemed unbeatable.

Dino Bravo and Demolition also spent time under his tutelage, and Johnny was known to do color commentary for WWE broadcasts as well. In 1989, he moved back to the AWA, where he managed Wayne Bloom & Mike Enos to the AWA Tag Team Championship. When the AWA closed, Johnny went into semi-retirement.Jimmy, on the other hand, stayed in the ring. He left WWE and headed to Memphis, Tenn., where he had a lengthy rivalry with Jerry Lawler, before moving onto the NWA in the mid-1980s. Rechristened as \"The Boogie Woogie Man,\" Jimmy was one of the most popular wrestlers in the southern United States. His lengthy rivalry with Paul Jones is still revered as one of the greatest of all-time; Jimmy fought Jones and his seemingly never-ending stable of associates for years, and both Jimmy and Jones had their heads shaved by the other during the course of their war.

In 1982, he took a regionally-based Dallas promotion called Big Time Wrestling, approved a name change of the group to World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW), and the rest was history. The promotion became one of the most respected groups in the country. The Fabulous Freebirds, Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts, manager Paul Bearer (known then as Percy Pringle), and a young rookie from San Antonio who went on to become Shawn Michaels were among those recognizable names that plied their craft for WCCW.But it was three Von Erich brothers that stood out in WCCW: Kevin, David, and Kerry. While Kevin and David generally based their careers within the framework of WCCW, it was Kerry who became the most successful Von Erich brother. In 1984, Kerry defeated Ric Flair to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, and in the summer of 1990, Kerry began competing in WWE as \"The Texas Tornado,\" and won the Intercontinental Championship from Mr. Perfect at SummerSlam in 1990.

Forming an alliance with The Barbarian and Ivan Koloff, The Warlord became a natural enemy of NWA heroes like Dusty Rhodes and The Road Warriors who were dwarfed by the 6-foot-5 brute. The two sides traded the short-lived Six Man Tag Team Championships before The Powers of Pain moved to WWE in ’88.Arriving, somewhat unexpectedly, as good guys, The Warlord and The Barbarian aligned themselves with the mysterious Baron and set their sights on the villainous team of Demolition — WWE’s answer to the post-apocalyptic aesthetic of The Road Warriors. The Powers of Pain didn’t wear the white hats for long, though, as they soon linked up with the devious Mr. Fuji after the manager turned his back on Demolition in a classic double-cross at 1988’s Survivor Series.Regaining their mean streak, The Powers of Pain showed the raw ability to be WWE’s next dominant tag team with The Warlord’s incomparable strength and The Barbarian’s unmatched fury. Yet, although they made short work of unimpressive local tandems, the duo struggled in marquee matchups against Demolition, The Hart Foundation and even The Bushwhackers.The Warlord soon distanced himself from The Barbarian and struck out as a singles competitor with Slick as his manager. Updating his look to include a metallic half mask and armor-plated shoulder pads, the big man reinvented himself as a real-life He Man villain. The Warlord was a nightmare for the no-name competitors of the early ’90s with his running powerslam and a devastating Full Nelson. Still, when it came time to battle a known entity in “The British Bulldog” Davey Boy Smith, the powerhouse failed to find any traction, losing his most high-profile bout to the Englishman at WrestleMania VII.An automobile accident in the mid-90s brought an untimely end to The Warlord’s career, but his impact has lasted long since he left sports-entertainment.');

Afa would then train his brother, Leati \"Sika\" Anoa\'i, and the two would form a tag team.

Afa & Sika were two men of very few words, but of many quirks. They grunted, picked their noses, they ate raw fish and they … starred in movies? Yes, Afa & Sika were cast in the 1987 cult-classic Body Slam, which also starred The Tonga Kid (Afa\'s nephew), as well as WWE Hall of Famer Roddy Piper. Most importantly, though, they won championships.Afa & Sika claimed their first World Tag Team Championship in April 1980, holding the titles for nearly four months. Their second run would last two months, while their third and final title reign would be the longest, at just over eight months. They battled the likes of Tony Garea & Rick Martel, Bob Backlund & Pedro Morales, The Strongbows and even cousin Rocky Johnson. It was the team of Johnson & Tony Atlas that ended the third title reign of The Wild Samoans.When The Wild Samoans split, Sika sought out the managerial services of Mr. Fuji, and even took part in the WrestleMania IV Battle Royal. Afa was not seen in WWE until returning in 1992 to manage The Headshrinkers, a team with ties to The Wild Samoans, both professionally and by blood.

The Headshrinkers terrorized WWE competition under the leadership of Afa, and captured the World Tag Team Championship on one occasion.The Wild Samoans\' impact in the ring as performers was immense, and they have continued to have a huge impact on the world of wrestling since their in-ring escapades ended. They no longer have the unorthodox behavior that made them so dangerous in the ‘70s, but they have over 30 years of wrestling knowledge which they have been sharing with their students at The Wild Samoan Training Center.Afa & Sika have trained many of the Superstars WWE fans have come to know over the years, including former WWE Champion Yokozuna and former WWE Superstars Rikishi, Tonga Kid, Virgil, Michael P.S.

That he went on to become SmackDown’s General Manager is a testament to Long’s hard work, smarts and keen understanding of professional wrestling that is matched by few.Working his way from the ground up, Teddy learned everything there is to know about the squared circle by experiencing it. First performing odd jobs for the Atlanta-based Jim Crockett Promotions, Long eventually became an official and presided over many of Ric Flair’s biggest matches. From there, he turned to managing where he guided heavy hitters like Ron Simmons, Butch Reed and Sid to major success.In 1999, he joined WWE, once again working as an official before transitioning back to managing. Repping bad dudes like Mark Henry and Rodney Mack in a stable dubbed Thuggin’ and Buggin’ Enterprises, Long displayed his knack for harnessing the raw power of tough Superstars.T-Lo proved he was more than just a gifted guide in 2004 when he became the first African-American General Manager of SmackDown. Bringing some much needed swagger to the position, the executive refused to be intimidated by tough Superstars as he fined Kurt Angle and stripped Booker T of the United States Title. He even beat Eric Bischoff in a battle of General Managers at Survivor Series in 2005. But Teddy’s true talent has always been doing the right thing. Case in point, he placed Rey Mysterio in a Triple Threat bout for the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 22 after the masked man had been cheated out of his spot by Randy Orton. The Master of the 619 grabbed the coveted title thanks to this opportunity.Following a 2008 stint as ECW General Manager that saw Long introduce Kofi Kingston, Jack Swagger and Evan Bourne to the WWE Universe, the Alabama native reclaimed his SmackDown GM position. Although he’d become the longest running GM in WWE history during that tenure, it hadn’t been an easy one. From being kidnapped by The Undertaker to getting attacked by Drew McIntyre, Long had his share of rough nights, but it never stopped him from working to entertain the WWE Universe.Though Long’s time as SmackDown GM ended unceremoniously at WrestleMania XXVIII, when rival John Laurinaitis won control of the blue brand, WWE fans will long remember his many contributions to SmackDown.

In the early 1980s, when the masked highflier from Japan made his name as the world’s finest junior heavyweight, watching one of his matches was like looking into the future of professional wrestling. At a time when most Superstars were glued firmly to the mat, Tiger Mask took to the sky, busting out Space Flying Tiger Drops and twisting moonsaults that left opponents — and announcers — completely baffled.If Tiger Mask’s offense was ahead of its time, his mythos was rooted firmly in the past. When he first debuted in New Japan Pro Wrestling on April 23, 1981, his royal blue tights and distinctive mask were immediately recognized as the trademarks of a hero from a lively 1960s cartoon. The anime — which told the story of a heroic professional wrestler who supports a children’s hospital while battling a villainous cadre known as the Tiger Cave — had been licensed by New Japan executives who were trying to grow interest in their budding junior heavyweight division.The character’s journey from two-dimensional animation cels to the real world may have been an awkward one were it not for Satoru Sayama. A former student of WWE Hall of Famer Antonio Inoki and Karl Gotch, the 23-year-old had experienced modest success in Mexico and England under the name Sammy Lee. But the moment Sayama donned the striped hood — whiskers and all — to defeat The Dynamite Kid in his debut match, he turned Tiger Mask into something much more than a cartoon come to life.Over the next two years, Tiger Mask would distinguish himself as not only the top junior heavyweight in New Japan, but in the entire world. On Jan. 1, 1982, he officially staked that claim by winning the WWE Junior Heavyweight Championship — which had made an unexpected journey from New York to Japan around the waist of Tatsumi Fujinami — with another triumph over The Dynamite Kid. The rough Brit became Tiger Mask’s top rival and the two men pushed each other to the limit in matches that are just as exhilarating today as they were in the days of VHS.WWE brought Tiger Mask to America in winter 1982, where he battled future stars like Eddie Gilbert and Curt Hennig from the majestic Madison Square Garden to obscure corners of the northeast like Belleville, N.J. Back in Japan, he continued to thrill against rivals like The Dynamite Kid and Black Tiger — another character from the “Tiger Mask” series — while innovating maneuvers like Rey Mysterio’s 619 (known in some circles as the Tiger Feint Kick) and the Tiger Suplex.Sayama disowned the Tiger Mask persona in 1984, but the character endures to this day. After first being adopted by the legendary Mitsuharu Misawa, the cartoon hero has remained a constant presence in the rings of Japan, with a fifth competitor wearing the hood today. Still, no version of Tiger Mask — and very few junior heavyweights — had the cultural and professional impact of Satoru Sayama.');

This distinction earned him the moniker of “The ECW Original” and the admiration of the Philly faithful, but The City of Brotherly Love wasn’t always so kind to Tommy Dreamer.Starting out in ECW as a grinning good guy in sequined suspenders in ’92, the clean-cut do-gooder was relentlessly jeered by the harsh ECW Arena audiences who rejected his pretty boy image. It wasn’t until Tommy took a beating from the beer-swilling Sandman that he gained the fans’ respect.

While most Superstars slowly walked to the squared circle, Warrior sprinted full speed down the entrance ramp and ran circles around the ring before shaking the ropes like a man possessed.The wild Superstar\'s matches were often as quick as his entrances.

In the months that followed, he battled Superstars like Undertaker, Papa Shango and Sid, but disappeared from the ring suddenly.Throughout the ’90s, Warrior made sporadic returns to WWE, including a smashing of a young Triple H at WrestleMania XII, and finally popped up in World Championship Wrestling for a rematch with Hogan at Halloween Havoc in 1998.

By the time he arrived in the Atlanta-based organization, the native of Nagoya, Japan, was a seasoned professional capable of pushing opponents like Rey Mysterio, Dean Malenko and William Regal to their physical limits.Cutting an impressive presence in his radiant capes and cowls, Ultimo Dragon became a key player in WCW’s acclaimed Cruiserweight division, carrying the prestigious title twice in addition to holding as many as eight international titles at the same time.

Mainstream success eluded him in America where he was mostly known as a fringe player — the type of disturbed outsider who doused opponents with buckets of plasma and hung tight with firebrand rap outfit the Insane Clown Posse. Still, Vampiro’s controversial affronts to Sting, Eddie Guerrero and even The Kiss Demon made him a competitor worth remembering.Outfitted in all black with ratty dreadlocks and the grease-painted face of a George A.

Gagne rightfully took his place among many of sports-entertainment\'s other big names when he was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2006.Growing up in Robbinsdale, Minn., Gagne was a three-sport athlete. While he also played baseball and football, his true skill was in wrestling, where he won multiple state championships. He then went on to the University of Minnesota, where he continued to play football and wrestle. He left after one year to join the Marines at the end of World War II, but returned to finish his college career a few years later. When his amateur days were over, Verne had four Big Ten Wrestling Championships, two NCAA Wrestling Championships, the 1949 AAU Wrestling Championship and a slot on the 1948 United States Olympic team on his resume.Following a brief stint playing for the NFL\'s Green Bay Packers, Verne turned to professional wrestling at the urging of promotor Tony Stecher. Making his debut in Minnesota in 1950, Verne won several regional championships in the 1950s before heading to the newly formed American Wrestling Association in 1960. In August 1960, he was awarded his first AWA Championship when the first recognized champion, then–NWA Champion Pat O\'Connor, failed to defend the championship against him. In the 1960s and 1970s, Verne became both a wrestler and a promoter, eventually becoming the sole owner of the AWA. He remained an active competitor until the early 1980s, holding the AWA Championship 10 times between 1960 and 1981, as well as the AWA Tag Team Championship with Mad Dog Vachon in 1979. His rivalry with Nick Bockwinkel over the AWA Championship produced many memorable matches, and in fact, those two men were the only two to hold the AWA Championship between 1968 and 1982, as Gagne\'s ninth reign spanned over seven years. Although Verne officially retired in 1981, he would later wrestle in several special matches while still maintaining ownership of the AWA.A key contributor to the business during its expansion boom in the 1980s, the late Gagne is also partially responsible for the phenomenon of Hulkamania. After Hulk Hogan failed to capture the AWA Championship on several occasions, Gagne let him leave the AWA in late 1983. Hogan immediately made his way to WWE, defeated fellow WWE Hall of Famer The Iron Sheik for the WWE Championship in January 1984, and the rest is history.During the AWA\'s existence, it was the breeding ground for several other future WWE Superstars, including Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura, Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan, Pat Patterson, The Legion of Doom, Shawn Michaels & Marty Jannetty, Curt Hennig, Scott Hall and fellow 2006 Hall of Fame Inductees \"Mean\" Gene Okerlund and \"Sensational\" Sherri. Jerry \"The King\" Lawler, Larry Zbyszko, Sgt. Slaughter and numerous other legends also wrestled in Gagne\'s AWA, and Verne\'s son Greg also had a lengthy and successful career there as well. In addition, Gagne had a hand in training several future Superstars, including Ric Flair, Ken Patera, Bob Backlund and Ricky Steamboat.After the AWA ceased operations in 1991, Gagne left the wrestling business, eventually selling the AWA video library to WWE in 2003. Although he has been out of the business since then, Gagne\'s contributions to sports-entertainment are unmistakable, and he is certainly worthy of the title bestowed on him the night before WrestleMania 22: Hall of Famer. ');

This simple act makes her one of the most reviled managers in the history of WWE.When the widow of WWE Hall of Famer Eddie Guerrero joined the company in 2007, it was as the assistant to SmackDown General Manager Teddy Long.

After Stephanie McMahon spewed a tainted iced coffee (and a little extra) on Guerrero, Vickie entered Roman Reigns into a WWE World Heavyweight Championship Ladder Match Qualifying Battle Royal against their orders.With her job on the line the following week, Vickie Guerrero was forced to battle Stephanie McMahon herself in a bizarre encounter involving a tub filled with a brown, foul-smelling substance.

Vickie went out on a high note, however, when she threw an unsuspecting Stephanie right into the viscous mess!Devious, shrewd and willing to use either her brains or her beauty to get what she wants, Vickie’s piercing proclamations and deceitful machinations made her the go-to target for the WWE Universe’s hatred and, ultimately, respect.');

She rode the momentum to defeat Molly Holly, Lita and Jazz in February 2004 to win her second Women’s Championship, a reign that featured her shaving Holly’s hair at WrestleMania XX.Although she briefly embraced her dancing side, the crazy resurfaced when Victoria’s attention turned to other Divas on the roster.

Vince, Sr. played in MSG as a child, accurately believing that, in some way, the building belonged to him.From the time Vince, Sr. took over Capitol Wrestling Corporation from his father, the company continued to flourish in the northeastern United States. In 1963, however, McMahon and his partner, Toots Mondt, broke away from the National Wrestling Alliance; Capitol Wrestling went by the wayside, and the World Wide Wrestling Federation (later to become WWE) was officially born. In the days of regional wrestling territories, WWE was the largest, stretching from Maine to Washington, D.C.In time, the organization gained so much respect that McMahon\'s former rivals again coveted him as a business associate. Meanwhile, the distinguished business titan was schooling his son, Vincent Kennedy McMahon, on the fine points of the industry.In the ultimate example of the cliché \"like father, like son,\" WWE once again changed direction when the elder McMahon sold his company to his son in 1982. Vincent K. McMahon began to take WWE national, and sports-entertainment was altered more than anyone ever imagined. Unfortunately, the elder McMahon was never able to truly enjoy the fruit of his son\'s labor; on May 24, 1984, just months after the phenomenon of Hulkamania began bringing WWE into the mainstream spotlight, Vincent James McMahon passed away at the age of 69.In 1996, Vince, Sr. took his rightful place in the WWE Hall of Fame; he was inducted by grandson Shane McMahon, the fourth generation of sports-entertainment\'s most influential family to take up the family business.While WWE is now an entity that Vince McMahon, Sr. may never have imagined in his wildest dreams, the company still stands the foundation he laid after taking over the family business from his own father.');

Virgil stuck with the wealthy competitor as his silent enforcer for more than three years, often finding himself matched against some of WWE\'s greatest Superstars in an attempt to soften them up for his employer.Finally, in 1991, Virgil got fed up with his boss’s abuse and turned against his partner, smashing him in the head with the Million Dollar Championship after a tag team victory at Royal Rumble. The rebellion instantly made Virgil one of WWE\'s most popular Superstars, and with additional training from \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper, he began a quest to take the Million Dollar Title from DiBiase. Finally, at SummerSlam 1991 in Madison Square Garden, Virgil beat his former mentor to temporarily claim the gold. Virgil would remain a fixture in WWE until 1994, often teaming with other popular Superstars such as Tito Santana.In 1996, Virgil resurfaced in WCW.

He then once again reinvented himself as Curly Bill, joining the West Texas Rednecks for a spell until leaving WCW in 2000 and effectively retiring from sports-entertainment.Whether he was loved or hated, Virgil was one of the most respected Superstars of the 1980s and 1990s, as he was always willing to put himself into battle to protect his interests.');

Joining the likes of Bret \"Hit Man\" Hart, Bruno Sammartino, The Iron Sheik and Andre the Giant were several football players. Many didn\'t think that the football players would stand a chance against the giants of the squared circle, but if anyone had a chance, it was The Fridge. Additionally, since The Fridge was one of the most popular players to ever play for the Bears, he also had the home field advantage.Before the match even started, The Fridge seemed to pick out his primary target: WWE Hall of Famer Big John Studd. The Fridge isn\'t used to being the smaller man, but Studd did have a size advantage over the master of the gridiron. Amidst all of the chaos during the match, Studd did manage to eliminate Perry over the top rope. But The Fridge wasn\'t about to leave quietly. He extended his hand for a handshake, seemingly to acknowledge the better man had won. Studd reached out to Perry, but once their hands met, The Fridge pulled the WWE Hall of Famer over the top rope, eliminating him. The Fridge had outsmarted Studd.Eliminating one WWE Hall of Famer in a battle royal on the grandest stage of them all is an impressive accomplishment in itself. But before being eliminated by Studd, The Fridge also managed to eliminate another Class of 2006 WWE Hall of Fame inductee, Tony Atlas. Eliminating two WWE Hall of Famers in one WrestleMania is a feat that no celebrity will probably ever match.Perry\'s WrestleMania accomplishment is one that few will forget, but his accomplishments in the NFL are more impressive. The Fridge burst onto the scene in the NFL as a first round draft pick by the Bears in 1985. He immediately impressed with his defensive line play, but he also had the unique opportunity to play on offense on occasion. In fact, The Fridge was even called upon during Super Bowl XX to run the ball, and he made the most of it, running over a slew of New England Patriots and into the end zone for a touchdown.');

Frankly, either persona is one you would not want to be on the wrong side of.As a teenager, Regal traveled the roads of his native United Kingdom, wrestling fellow grapplers, as well as complete strangers out of the crowd, as part of a touring carnival act. Here, he fostered a reputation as a lethal opponent whose crushing submissions and stiff strikes could render even the heartiest adversaries totally helpless. Regal diversified his abilities by traveling the world, mastering different styles and winning championships in Europe, the Middle East and Japan.After finding further success in WCW, Regal carved a tremendous legacy in WWE, winning numerous championships and accolades worthy of such a competitor, including the mantle of Raw General Manager in 2007. Arguably his crowning achievement, however, was when he became truly regal, winning the prestigious 2008 King of the Ring Tournament.In August 2014, Regal was appointed the new General Manager of NXT and, between signing international stars and sanctioning boundary-breaking contests, he’s helped the brand take its place on the cutting edge of sports-entertainment.
